I blog about research methods, particularly for psychology, and particularly with regard to data analysis.

As a non-virtual person, I work as a professor at [FOM University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fom.de/die-fom-englisch/the-university-for-the-professionals.html). 

Posts reflect mostly my current thinking; and posts are not immune to thought updates. With luck things get less wrong in the course of time.
