abstract = {Background: There are no consistent predictors of treatment outcome in paediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). One reason for this might be the use of suboptimal statistical methodology. Machine learning is an approach to efficiently analyse complex data. Machine learning has been widely used within other fields, but has rarely been tested in the prediction of paediatric mental health treatment outcome. Objective: To test four different machine learning methods in the prediction of treatment response in a sample of paediatric OCD patients that had received internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT). Methods: All clinical baseline variables in N=61 adolescents (12-17 years) with OCD were used to predict treatment response three months after ICBT. Four machine learning algorithms were implemented. For comparison, we also employed a more traditional logistic regression approach. Results: Classical multivariate logistic regression could not detect any significant predictors. In contrast, all four machine learning algorithms performed well in the prediction of treatment response, with 75 to 83% accuracy. Conclusions: The results suggest that machine learning algorithms can successfully be applied to predict paediatric OCD treatment outcome. Validation studies and studies in other paediatric conditions are warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pathological gambling is a behavioural addiction with negative economic, social, and psychological consequences. Identification of contributing genes and pathways may improve understanding of aetiology and facilitate therapy and prevention. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study of pathological gambling. Our aims were to identify pathways involved in pathological gambling, and examine whether there is a genetic overlap between pathological gambling and alcohol dependence. METHODS Four hundred and forty-five individuals with a diagnosis of pathological gambling according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were recruited in Germany, and 986 controls were drawn from a German general population sample. A genome-wide association study of pathological gambling comprising single marker, gene-based, and pathway analyses, was performed. Polygenic risk scores were generated using data from a German genome-wide association study of alcohol dependence. RESULTS No genome-wide significant association with pathological gambling was found for single markers or genes. Pathways for Huntington's disease (P-value=6.63×10(-3)); 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signalling (P-value=9.57×10(-3)); and apoptosis (P-value=1.75×10(-2)) were significant. Polygenic risk score analysis of the alcohol dependence dataset yielded a one-sided nominal significant P-value in subjects with pathological gambling, irrespective of comorbid alcohol dependence status. CONCLUSIONS The present results accord with previous quantitative formal genetic studies which showed genetic overlap between non-substance- and substance-related addictions. Furthermore, pathway analysis suggests shared pathology between Huntington's disease and pathological gambling. This finding is consistent with previous imaging studies.},

abstract = {In light of the upcoming eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), the question arises as to the most appropriate classification of 'Pathological Gambling' ('PG'). Some academic opinion favors leaving PG in the 'Impulse Control Disorder' ('ICD') category, as in ICD-10, whereas others argue that new data especially from the neurobiological area favor allocating it to the category of 'Substance-related and Addictive Disorders' ('SADs'), following the decision in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The current review examines important findings in relation to PG, with the aim of enabling a well-informed decision to be made with respect to the classification of PG as a SAD or ICD in ICD-11. Particular attention is given to cognitive deficits and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that play a role in SADs and ICDs. These processes are impulsivity, compulsivity, reward/punishment processing and decision-making. In summary, the strongest arguments for subsuming PG under a larger SAD category relate to the existence of similar diagnostic characteristics; the high co-morbidity rates between the disorders; their common core features including reward-related aspects (positive reinforcement: behaviors are pleasurable at the beginning which is not the case for ICDs); the findings that the same brain structures are involved in PG and SADs, including the ventral striatum. Research on compulsivity suggests a relationship with PG and SAD, particularly in later stages of the disorders. Although research is limited for ICDs, current data do not support continuing to classify PG as an ICD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND While DSM-5 classified pathological gambling as an addictive disorder, there is debate as to whether ICD-11 should follow suit. The debate hinges on scientific evidence such as neurobiological findings, family history of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and personality variables. METHODS In the "Baden-W{{\"{u}}}rttemberg Study of Pathological Gambling", we compared a group of 515 male pathological gamblers receiving treatment with 269 matched healthy controls. We studied differences in sociodemographic characteristics, gambling-related variables, psychiatric comorbidity (lifetime), family history of psychiatric conditions, as well as personality traits such as impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale), sensation seeking (Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale) and the NEO-FFI big five. Personality traits were validated in an age- and ethnicity-matched subsample of "pure" gamblers without any psychiatric comorbidity (including nicotine dependence). Data were analyzed using two-sample t-tests, Chi(2) analyses, Fisher's exact test and Pearson correlation analysis, as appropriate. Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. RESULTS Only 1{%} of the gamblers had been diagnosed with an impulse control disorder other than gambling (ICD-10). Notably, 88{%} of the gamblers in our sample had a comorbid diagnosis of substance dependence. The highest axis I comorbidity rate was for nicotine dependence (80{%}), followed by alcohol dependence (28{%}). Early age of first gambling experience was correlated with gambling severity. Compared to first-degree relatives of controls, first-degree relatives of pathological gamblers were more likely to suffer from alcohol dependence (27.0{%} vs. 7.4{%}), pathological gambling (8.3{%} vs. 0.7{%}) and suicide attempts (2.7{%} vs. 0.4{%}). Significant group differences were observed for the NEO-FFI factors neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Gamblers were also more impulsive than controls, but did not differ from controls in terms of sensation seeking. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support classifying pathological gambling as a behavioural addiction in the ICD-11. This decision will have a significant impact on the approaches available for prevention (e.g. age limits) and treatment.},

The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification. METHODS 1,870 European adolescents (Mage = 14.56 years, SDage = 0.44 years, 51.5{%} female) underwent MRI scanning and completed behavioral and psychological measures of stressful life events, academic competence, social competence, rule-abiding conduct, personality, and alcohol use. RESULTS The interaction of competence and adversity identified two regions centered on the right middle and superior frontal gyri; grey matter volumes in these regions were larger in adolescents experiencing adversity who showed positive adaptation. Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.},

Shorter time in bed during weekdays, and later weekend sleeping hours correlate with smaller brain grey matter volumes in frontal, anterior cingulate, and precuneus cortex regions. Poor school grade average associates with later weekend bedtime and smaller grey matter volumes in medial brain regions. The medial prefrontal - anterior cingulate cortex appears most tightly related to the adolescents' variations in sleep habits, as its volume correlates inversely with both weekend bedtime and wake up time, and also with poor school performance. These findings suggest that sleep habits, notably during the weekends, have an alarming link with both the structure of the adolescent brain and school performance, and thus highlight the need for informed interventions.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging in pathological gambling (PG) allows studying brain structure independent of pharmacological/neurotoxic effects occurring in substance addiction. Because of high comorbidity of PG with substance use disorder (SUD), first results on structural deficits in PG are controversial. The current investigation is the first to examine gray matter (GM) volume alterations in PG controlling for the impact of SUD by comparing non-comorbid (PGPURE ) and two comorbid (PGALCOHOL and PGPOLY ) groups. Two hundred and five individuals were included in the analysis: 107 patients diagnosed with PG and 98 healthy controls (HCs). We employed voxel-based morphometry to look for GM volume differences between the groups controlling for age, smoking and depression. GM decreases in the superior medial and orbital frontal cortex occur independently of substance use in PGPURE compared with HCs. The frontal pattern of GM decrease was comparable with PGALCOHOL group where additionally GM volume was decreased in the anterior cingulate but increased in the amygdala. Moreover, regions in PGALCOHOL + POLY with reduced GM volume were the medial frontal, anterior cingulate and occipital lobe regions. PGALCOHOL + POLY not only exhibited structural deficits in comparison with HCs but also relative to PGPURE in the precuneus and post-central gyrus. We demonstrated specific frontal cortex GM deficits in PG without SUD comorbidities. Whereas some target regions reported in earlier studies might result from comorbid substance abuse, there seems to be a core set of frontal alterations associated with addicted gambling behaviour independent of toxic substance effects.},

abstract = {Evidence-based strategies for screening, diagnosing and treating alcohol use disorders (AUD) are instrumental in the early and better management of individuals at risk for or suffering from AUD. However, existing guidelines vary and may be biased by conflicts of interests. Unbiased recommendations can be achieved only if sufficient detail is provided on the composition and representativeness of author groups, methodological rigor, handling of potential conflicts of interest and financing. This paper presents the first evidence-based guidelines for AUD from German-speaking countries. These guidelines are based on the work of delegates from a representative sample of 46 scientific societies (mostly medical) from Austria, Germany and Switzerland dealing with AUD. It also included patients and relatives. Recommendations were derived from a standardised hierarchical process involving quality controls drawn from existing guidelines, de novo literature searches and/or expert experience. Potential conflicts of interest were assessed yearly and led to exclusion from voting in specific areas. An overall cost of more than 400,000€ (for alcohol and tobacco guidelines) were exclusively covered by the participating societies and academic institutions. More than 100 recommendations on screening, diagnostics and treatment of AUD are outlined in this paper, and their scientific background is given in the online supplementary material. Tables of aggregated study synopses (in English) and the full version of guidelines (in German) are available (see "Links").},

abstract = {The number of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) is on the rise worldwide along with the fascination that they inspire. Problems occur when the use of MMOs becomes excessive at the expense of other life domains. Although not yet formally included as disorder in common diagnostic systems, internet gaming disorder (IGD) is considered a "condition for further study" in section III of the DSM-5. The current review aims to provide an overview of cognitive and neurobiological data currently available on IGD, with a particular focus on impulsivity, compulsivity, and sensitivity to reward and punishment. Additionally, we also compare these findings on IGD with data from studies on pathological gambling (PG)-so far the only condition officially classified as a behavioral addiction in the DSM-5. Multiple similarities have been observed in the neurobiology of IGD and PG, as measured by alterations in brain function and behavior. Both patients with IGD and those with PG exhibited decreased loss sensitivity; enhanced reactivity to gaming and gambling cues, respectively; enhanced impulsive choice behavior; aberrant reward-based learning; and no changes in cognitive flexibility. In conclusion, the evidence base on the neurobiology of gaming and gambling disorders is beginning to illuminate the similarities between the two. However, as only a few studies have addressed the neurobiological basis of IGD, and some of these studies suffer from significant limitations, more research is required before IGD's inclusion as a second behavioral addiction in the next versions of the ICD and DSM can be justified.},

abstract = {Novelty-seeking tendencies in adolescents may promote innovation as well as problematic impulsive behaviour, including drug abuse. Previous research has not clarified whether neural hyper- or hypo-responsiveness to anticipated rewards promotes vulnerability in these individuals. Here we use a longitudinal design to track 144 novelty-seeking adolescents at age 14 and 16 to determine whether neural activity in response to anticipated rewards predicts problematic drug use. We find that diminished BOLD activity in mesolimbic (ventral striatal and midbrain) and prefrontal cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) regions during reward anticipation at age 14 predicts problematic drug use at age 16. Lower psychometric conscientiousness and steeper discounting of future rewards at age 14 also predicts problematic drug use at age 16, but the neural responses independently predict more variance than psychometric measures. Together, these findings suggest that diminished neural responses to anticipated rewards in novelty-seeking adolescents may increase vulnerability to future problematic drug use.},

abstract = {New information from neuroimaging studies on alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is available which necessitates an update on our review on alcohol and the human brain published in 2010. Here, we provide an overview on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and imaging genetics studies published in the last 5 years. Our systematic search in PubMed yielded a total of 70 fMRI studies out of which 57 were finally considered. We have summarized the study results based on their main research focus as follows: studies on neural correlates of reward processing (alcohol cues (N = 17), non-drug cues (N = 3)), decision making (N = 2), attention (N = 5), impulsivity and cognitive control (N = 1), pharmacological effects/treatment responses (N = 13) and relapse prediction (N = 6). Neuroimaging genetics studies have mainly considered the impact of various functional polymorphisms on alcohol cue processing (N = 10). These results indicate that recent research on AUDs has concentrated on reward processing (mainly alcohol cue reactivity). Possible directions for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {Adolescence is a time that can set the course of alcohol abuse later in life. Sensitivity to reward on multiple levels is a major factor in this development. We examined 736 adolescents from the IMAGEN longitudinal study for alcohol drinking during early (mean age=14.37) and again later (mean age=16.45) adolescence. Conducting structural equation modeling we evaluated the contribution of reward-related personality traits, behavior, brain responses and candidate genes. Personality seems to be most important in explaining alcohol drinking in early adolescence. However, genetic variations in ANKK1 (rs1800497) and HOMER1 (rs7713917) play an equal role in predicting alcohol drinking two years later and are most important in predicting the increase in alcohol consumption. We hypothesize that the initiation of alcohol use may be driven more strongly by personality while the transition to increased alcohol use is more genetically influenced.},

The accuracy of our predictions depends on the quality of our present knowledge and accuracy of our observations. Weather forecasts are a familiar example—the more we know about how weather works, the better we can use current observations and seasonal records to predict whether it will rain tomorrow and any disagreement between prediction and observation can be used to refine the weather model. Bayesian statistics embodies this cycle of applying previous theoretical and empirical knowledge to formulate hypotheses, rank them on the basis of observed data and update prior probability estimates and hypotheses using observed data1. This will be our first of a series of columns about Bayesian statistics. This month, we'll introduce the topic using one of its key concepts—Bayes' theorem—and expand to include topics such as Bayesian inference and networks in future columns.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As computational power improves, the application of more advanced machine learning techniques to the analysis of large genome-wide association (GWA) datasets becomes possible. While most traditional statistical methods can only elucidate main effects of genetic variants on risk for disease, certain machine learning approaches are particularly suited to discover higher order and non-linear effects. One such approach is the Random Forests (RF) algorithm. The use of RF for SNP discovery related to human disease has grown in recent years; however, most work has focused on small datasets or simulation studies which are limited.

RESULTS: Using a multiple sclerosis (MS) case-control dataset comprised of 300 K SNP genotypes across the genome, we outline an approach and some considerations for optimally tuning the RF algorithm based on the empirical dataset. Importantly, results show that typical default parameter values are not appropriate for large GWA datasets. Furthermore, gains can be made by sub-sampling the data, pruning based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), and removing strong effects from RF analyses. The new RF results are compared to findings from the original MS GWA study and demonstrate overlap. In addition, four new interesting candidate MS genes are identified, MPHOSPH9, CTNNA3, PHACTR2 and IL7, by RF analysis and warrant further follow-up in independent studies.

CONCLUSIONS: This study presents one of the first illustrations of successfully analyzing GWA data with a machine learning algorithm. It is shown that RF is computationally feasible for GWA data and the results obtained make biologic sense based on previous studies. More importantly, new genes were identified as potentially being associated with MS, suggesting new avenues of investigation for this complex disease.},

abstract = {<AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The Fibromyalgia
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a composite disease-specific measure
validated for fibromyalgia (FM), but it is rarely used in clinical
practice. The objective was to develop and analyse the psychometric
properties of a new composite disease-specific index (Fibromyalgia
Assessment Status, FAS), a simple self-administered index that combines
a patient's assessment of fatigue, sleep disturbances and pain evaluated
on the basis of the 16 non-articular sites listed on the Self-Assessment
Pain Scale (SAPS) in a single measure (range 0 to 10).</AbstractText>
<AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The FAS index
was constructed using a traditional development strategy, and its
psychometric properties were tested in 226 FM patients (209 women,
17 men); whose disease-related characteristics were assessed by means
of an 11-numbered circular numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain,
fatigue, sleep disturbances and general health (GH), the tender point
score (TPS), the SAPS, the FIQ, and the SF-36. A group of 226 rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) patients was used for comparative purposes. Of the
179 FM patients who entered the follow-up study, 152 completed the
three-month period and were included in the responsiveness analyses.
One hundred and fifty-four patients repeated the FAS questionnaire
after an interval of one week, and its test/re-test reliability was
calculated. Responsiveness was evaluated on the basis of effect size
and the standardised response mean.</AbstractText> <AbstractText
Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The FAS index fulfilled the
established criteria for validity, reliability and responsiveness.
Factor analysis showed that SAPS and fatigue contributed most, and
respectively explained 47.4% and 31.2% of the variance; sleep explained
21.3%. Testing for internal consistency showed that Cronbach's alpha
was 0.781, thus indicating a high level of reliability. As expected,
closer significant correlations were found when FAS was compared
with total FIQ (rho = 0.347; P < 0.0001) and the FIQ subscales,
particularly job ability, tiredness, fatigue and pain (all P <
0.0001), but the correlation between FAS and the mental component
summary scale score (MCS) of the SF-36 (rho = -0.531; P < 0.0001)
was particularly interesting. Test/re-test reliability was satisfactory.
The FAS showed the greatest effect size. The magnitude of the responsiveness
measures was statistically different between FAS (0.889) and the
FIQ (0.781) (P = 0.038), and between the SF-36 MCS (0.434) and the
SF-36 physical component summary scale score (PCS) (0.321) (P <
0.01).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The
self-administered FAS is a reliable, valid and responsive disease-specific
composite measure for assessing treatment effect in patients with
FM.</AbstractText>},

abstract = {Rasch item response theory analysis is essential in evaluating measurement
tools in specific disease cohorts. We compared the performance of
4 functional indexes in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in
axial or peripheral disease subgroups.A cross-sectional study was
performed in a single center. Functional outcomes assessed by the
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
Functional Index (BASFI), Dougados Functional Index (FI), and the
physical functioning scale of the Medical Outcome Study Short-form
36 (SF-36-PF) were analyzed by the Rasch model for item fit, item
separation, measurement span, and distribution properties. Patient
subgroups with axial or peripheral disease were analyzed for differential
item functioning (DIF).One hundred eight patients with PsA were assessed.
The 4 functional indexes were highly correlated with each other and
moderately correlated with patients' perception of health and pain
scores. Floor effects were less marked in SF-36-PF. The 4 indexes
satisfied the unidimensionality assumption of the Rasch model. HAQ
and SF-36-PF had better information-weighted fit statistics (INFIT)
and outlier-sensitive (OUTFIT) statistics. HAQ had the poorest item
separation. SF-36-PF had the highest item separation (6.99), reliability
(0.85), and the longest span of item threshold (9.03 logits). Only
1 and 2 items in BASFI and Dougados-FI had DIF in patients with sacroiliitis.HAQ,
BASFI, Dougados-FI, and SF-36-PF provide unidimensional measures
of functional disability in PsA. SF-36-PF was the best in terms of
less floor effect, highest item separation, longest span of item
threshold, and better distributional properties. BASFI and Dougados-FI
behaved similarly in patients with and without sacroiliitis and conferred
no superiority in patients with axial disease.},

In 2 studies, both simple self-esteem and narcissism were measured, and then individual participants were given an opportunity to aggress against someone who had insulted them or praised them or against an innocent third person. Self-esteem proved irrelevant to aggression. The combination of narcissism and insult led to exceptionally high levels of aggression toward the source of the insult. Neither form of self-regard affected displaced aggression, which was low in general. These findings contradict the popular view that low self-esteem causes aggression and point instead toward threatened egotism as an important cause.},

@article{Myburgh2005,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The first democratic government elected in South Africa in 1994 inherited huge inequalities in health status and health provision across all sections of the population. This study set out to assess, 4 years later, the influence of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on perceived quality of care from health care providers. DESIGN: A 1998 countrywide survey of 3820 households assessed many aspects of health care delivery, including levels of satisfaction with health care providers among different segments of South African society. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent (n = 1953) of the respondents had attended a primary care facility in the year preceding the interview and were retained in the analysis. Both race and SES were significant predictors of levels of satisfaction with the services of the health care provider, after adjusting for gender, age, and type of facility visited. White and high SES respondents were about 1.5 times more likely to report excellent service compared with Black and low SES respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: In South Africa, race and SES are not synonymous and can no longer be considered reliable proxy indicators of one another. Each has distinct and significant but different degrees of association with client satisfaction. Any assessment of equity-driven health policy in South Africa should consider the impacts of both race and SES on client satisfaction as one of the indicators of success.},

A survey of 200 women who gave birth in July-August 2000 and 196 pregnant women in 34 communes in Quang Xuong District, Thanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. Main outcome measures. Inter-rater reliability, internal consistency and factor structure of the scale were examined. The associations between perceived quality and client characteristics were also investigated. Results. The instrument had relatively good inter-rater reliability and internal consistency. Except for two items: 'good clinical examination' and 'adequacy of health workers for women's health', the scale exhibited good agreement between the two raters, with kappa values ranging from 0.54 to 0.84. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the dimensions 'health care delivery', 'health facility', 'interpersonal aspects of care' and 'access to services' were 0.72, 0.64, 0.72 and 0.33, respectively. Respondents were positive on items related to the dimensions 'interpersonal aspects of care' and 'access to services', but negative on the dimensions 'health care delivery' and 'health facility'.

Unfortunately, such data snooping comes with a cost. When the null hypothesis is true, the Type I error rate is inflated, sometimes quite substantially. If the null hypothesis is false, premature significance testing leads to inflated estimates of power and effect size. This program provides simulation results for a wide variety of premature and repeated null hypothesis testing scenarios. It gives researchers the ability to know in advance the consequences of data peeking so that appropriate corrective action can be taken.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate how situational interest develops over time and how it is related to academic achievement in an active-learning classroom. Five measures of situational interest were administered at critical points in time to 69 polytechnic students during a one-day, problem-based learning session. Results revealed that situational interest significantly increased after the problem stimulus was presented. Subsequently, situational interest gradually decreased but at the end of the day increased again. Testing a path model relating the situational interest measures showed strong (directional) interrelations. Moreover, situational interest was highly predictive for observed achievement-related classroom behaviors. The latter, in turn, proved to be a significant predictor of academic achievement. Aggregating situational interest over the day led to less accurate predictions of achievement-related classroom behaviors and academic achievement. Implications of these findings for situational interest research are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article informs the reader about frequently used statistical tests and their correct application. METHODS: The most commonly used statistical tests were identified through a selective literature search on the methodology of medical research publications. These tests are discussed in this article, along with a selection of other standard methods of inferential statistics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Readers who are acquainted not just with descriptive methods, but also with Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t test will be able to interpret a large proportion of medical research articles. Criteria are presented for choosing the proper statistical test to be used out of the most frequently applied tests. An algorithm and a table are provided to facilitate the selection of the appropriate test.},

abstract = {Behavior and experience are organized around the enjoyment and pursuit of incentives. During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

A number of his conclusions have been overturned: youth and modest aspirations no longer are seen as prerequisites of SWB. E. Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of SWB that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing SWB, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of SWB (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).

Colored images are also used to specify color in graphics. Most computer graphics texts and tutorials provide a description of human color vision and measurement as defined by the CIE tristimulus values, XYZ. Often missing, however, is an in-depth discussion of the relationship between the different applications of RGB and XYZ, and any discussion of color models beyond trichromacy. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a complete, concise analysis of RGB color specification and its relationship to perceptual and physical specifications of color, and to introduce some models for color perception beyond tristimulus theory.},

@article{Turner2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials--and the outcomes within those trials--can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio.

METHODS: We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set.

RESULTS: Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69% for individual drugs and was 32% overall.

CONCLUSIONS: We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the representation of health
asset concepts in the International Classification of Nursing Practice
(ICNP). In a previous study we conducted a concept analysis of health
assets, building a conceptual model. The terms included in our conceptual
model were cross-mapped to the ICNP terminology system, Version 1.0/1.1.
Most of the health asset terms in the conceptual model were represented
in ICNP. However, for maximum support of both clinical nursing care
and patient self-care, a complete set of health asset terms is needed
in the ICNP. We advocate for more research to uncover patients' and
clinicians' detailed use of health asset terms. This should result
in a richer and more specific health assets vocabulary that could
be integrated into ICNP or other nursing terminologies as a means
to improve nursing care and to strengthen patients' self-management
of their illnesses. However, the findings from this first evaluation
of health asset terms in the ICNP are promising, at least on a global
level.},

pathways. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Study participants:
European Pathway Association (E-P-A) contact persons in 23 countries.
Results: Clinical pathways, also known as critical pathways or integrated
care pathways, have been used in health care for 20 years. Although
clinical pathways are well established, little information exists
on their use and dissemination around the world. The E-P-A has performed
their first international survey on the use and dissemination of
clinical pathways in 23 countries. At present, pathways are used
with a minority of patients, mainly in acute hospital trusts. Our
survey showed that clinical pathways were predominantly viewed as
a ultidisciplinary tool to improve the quality and efficiency of
evidence-based care. Pathways were also used as a communication tool
between professionals to manage and standardize outcome-oriented
care. Conclusions: There is a future for the use of clinical pathways,
but there is a need for international benchmarking and knowledge
sharing with regard to their development, implementation and evaluation.},

Health Center (SNAP 98) software to record health visits with 117
children. Group B comprised six nurses who used the same software
and NANDA, NIC, and NOC with 103 children. After use of the software,
the power of the 12 nurses to help children significantly increased.
For the 220 children, the number of coping strategies significantly
increased but there were no changes in the other health outcomes.
The hypotheses indicating that Group B nurses and children would
have more positive changes than Group A were not supported. Positive
and negative elements for large-scale studies were identified. (C)

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients report symptomatic relief after undergoing arthroscopy of the knee for osteoarthritis, but it is unclear how the procedure achieves this result. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee. METHODS: A total of 180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to receive arthroscopic d{\'{e}}bridement, arthroscopic lavage, or placebo surgery. Patients in the placebo group received skin incisions and underwent a simulated d{\'{e}}bridement without insertion of the arthroscope. Patients and assessors of outcome were blinded to the treatment-group assignment. Outcomes were assessed at multiple points over a 24-month period with the use of five self-reported scores--three on scales for pain and two on scales for function--and one objective test of walking and stair climbing. A total of 165 patients completed the trial. RESULTS: At no point did either of the intervention groups report less pain or better function than the placebo group. For example, mean (+/-SD) scores on the Knee-Specific Pain Scale (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) were similar in the placebo, lavage, and d{\'{e}}bridement groups: 48.9+/-21.9, 54.8+/-19.8, and 51.7+/-22.4, respectively, at one year (P=0.14 for the comparison between placebo and lavage; P=0.51 for the comparison between placebo and d{\'{e}}bridement) and 51.6+/-23.7, 53.7+/-23.7, and 51.4+/-23.2, respectively, at two years (P=0.64 and P=0.96, respectively). Furthermore, the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences between the placebo group and the intervention groups exclude any clinically meaningful difference. CONCLUSIONS: In this controlled trial involving patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, the outcomes after arthroscopic lavage or arthroscopic d{\'{e}}bridement were no better than those after a placebo procedure.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background: In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion: An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a 'best-evidence synthesis' approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion: Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods. ?? 2006 National University of Health Sciences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Osteoarthritis is a common chronic disease
associated with functional impairments and activity limitations,
as well as participation restrictions. The Comprehensive International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set
for Osteoarthritis is an application of the ICF and represents the
typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients with osteoarthritis.
OBJECTIVE To validate the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Osteoarthritis
from the perspective of physical therapists. METHODS Physical therapists
experienced in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis were
asked about patients' problems, resources and aspects of the environmental
factors treated by physical therapists in patients with osteoarthritis
in a three-round, electronic-mail survey using the Delphi technique.
Responses were linked to the ICF. RESULTS Seventy-two experts from
22 countries named 744 meaningful concepts that covered all ICF components.
One hundred and fifty-two ICF categories were linked to these answers,
32 concepts were linked to the not-yet-developed personal factors
component, and 14 issues were not covered by a single ICF category.
Twelve ICF categories were not represented in the Comprehensive ICF
Core Set for Osteoarthritis, although at least 75% of the participants
rated them as important. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The content validity
of the ICF was widely supported by the physical therapists. However,
several issues were raised that were not covered and need to be investigated
further.},

A self-report measure of student self-efficacy, intrinsic value, test anxiety, self-regulation, and use of learning strategies was administered, and performance data were obtained from work on classroom assignments. Self-efficacy and intrinsic value were positively related to cognitive engagement and performance. Regression analyses revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level. The implications of individual differences in motivational orientation for cognitive engagement and self-regulation in the classroom are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: . (i) To develop a reliable and valid scale to measure in-patient and outpatient perceptions of quality in India and (ii) to identify aspects of perceived quality which have large effects on patient satisfaction. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of health facilities and patients at clinics. SETTING: Primary health centers, community health centers, district hospitals, and female district hospitals in the state of Uttar Pradesh in north India. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Internal consistency, validity, and factor structure of the scale are evaluated. The association between patient satisfaction and perceived quality dimensions is examined. RESULTS: A 16-item scale having good reliability and validity is developed. Five dimensions of perceived quality are identified-medicine availability, medical information, staff behavior, doctor behavior, and hospital infrastructure. Patient perceptions of quality at public health facilities are slightly better than neutral. Multivariate regression analysis results indicate that for outpatients, doctor behavior has the largest effect on general patient satisfaction followed by medicine availability, hospital infrastructure, staff behavior, and medical information. For in-patients, staff behavior has the largest effect followed by doctor behavior, medicine availability, medical information, and hospital infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: The scale developed can be used to measure perceived quality at a range of facility types for outpatients and in-patients. Perceived quality at public facilities is only marginally favorable, leaving much scope for improvement. Better staff and physician interpersonal skills, facility infrastructure, and availability of drugs have the largest effect in improving patient satisfaction at public health facilities.},

The intraclass correlation for a set of classes in which the order of the values is arbitrary (and independent from one class to the next) is a non-negative quantity.

abstract = {A new method is presented for performing rapid and accurate numerical estimation. The method is derived from an area of human cognitive psychology called preattentive process-ing. Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual field based on cognitive operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, orientation, size, and motion. We believe that studies from preattentive vision should be used to assist in the de-sign of visualization tools, especially those for which high speed target detection, boundary identification, and region detection are important. In our present study, we investigated two known preattentive features (hue and orientation) in the context of a new task (numerical estimation) in order to see whether preattentive estimation was possible. Our experiments tested displays that were designed to visualize data from salmon migration simulations. The results showed that rapid and accurate estimation was indeed possible using either hue or orientation. Furthermore, random variation in one of these features resulted in no inter-ference when subjects estimated the percentage of the other. To test the generality of our results, we varied two important display parameters, display duration and feature differ-ence, and found boundary conditions for each. Implications of our results for application to real-word data and tasks are discussed.},

The 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) has been developed as a reliable and valid comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects of mindfulness in community and student samples. In this study, the psychometric properties of the Dutch FFMQ were assessed in a sample of 376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and by relating the FFMQ to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being, experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism and openness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the FFMQ (FFMQ-SF) was developed and assessed in the same sample and cross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia. Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for a correlated five-factor structure of the FFMQ and good model fit for the structure of the FFMQ-SF. The replicability of the five-factor structure of the FFMQ-SF was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Both instruments proved highly sensitive to change. It is concluded that both the FFMQ and the FFMQ-SF are reliable and valid instruments for use in adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.},

The most general findings were that conscientiousness positively predicted intrinsic and extrinsic career success, neuroticism negatively predicted extrinsic success, and general mental ability positively predicted extrinsic career success. Personality was related to career success controlling for general mental ability and, though adulthood measures of the Big Five traits were more strongly related to career success than were childhood measures, both contributed unique variance in explaining career success.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current laboratory tests exhibit high sensitivity and specificity combined with comparatively low costs thus favoring broad and uncritical ordering habits. METHODS: Introduction of Bayes' theorem and discussion of its implications for laboratory test results in a mostly non-technical form, accompanied by a selective literature review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: According to Bayes' theorem the positive predictive value of laboratory test results is directly dependent on the prevalence of the disease in a given patient cohort. Thus, the clinical value of a given test result is critically dependent on a precise indication. Ordering of tests that are not indicated in a given patient is clinically useless and undesirable, where detailed information on disease prevalence is missing. These considerations are valid irrespective of ethical or economic considerations.},

abstract = {Emotional reactions to naturally occurring sounds (e.g., screams, erotica, bombs, etc.) were investigated in two studies. In Experiment 1, subjects rated the pleasure and arousal elicited when listening to each of 60 sounds, followed by an incidental free recall task. The shape of the two-dimensional affective space defined by the mean ratings for each sound was similar to that previously obtained for pictures, and, like memory for pictures, free recall was highest for emotionally arousing stimuli. In Experiment 2, autonomic and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded while a new group of subjects listened to the same set of sounds; the startle reflex was measured using visual probes. Listening to unpleasant sounds resulted in larger startle reflexes, more corrugator EMG activity, and larger heart rate deceleration compared with listening to pleasant sounds. Electrodermal reactions were larger for emotionally arousing than for neutral materials. Taken together, the data suggest that acoustic cues activate the appetitive and defensive motivational circuits underlying emotional expression in ways similar to pictures.},

In particular, the high variance in the object of study (i.e., humans) prevents the use of Popper's falsification principle (which is the norm in other sciences). Therefore, the desirability of quantitative psychological models must be assessed by measuring the capacity of the model to fit empirical data. In the present paper, an error measure (likelihood), as well as five methods to compare model fits (the likelihood ratio test, Akaike's information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, bootstrapping and cross-validation), are presented. The use of each method is illustrated by an example, and the advantages and weaknesses of each method are also discussed. The},

Fifteen Vipassana meditators (mean practice: 7.9 years, 2h daily) and fifteen non-meditators, matched for sex, age, education, and handedness, participated in a block-design fMRI study that included mindfulness of breathing and mental arithmetic conditions. For the meditation condition (contrasted to arithmetic), meditators showed stronger activations in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex bilaterally, compared to controls. Greater rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation in meditators may reflect stronger processing of distracting events. The increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex may reflect that meditators are stronger engaged in emotional processing.},

hundred patients with neurological, musculoskeletal or cardiopulmonary
conditions requiring physiotherapy interventions in University Hospital
Zurich between January 2003 and October 2003.Main outcome measures<br/>The
case record form consisted of two parts: a standardised questionnaire
for functioning and health of the patient; and a standardised record
form for physiotherapy interventions. Both parts were based on the
ICF.Results<br/>The mean age of the subjects was 58.2 years (standard
deviation 15.9), the median age was 60.5 years and 44% were female.
The most frequent intervention goals in patients with neurological
conditions were: muscle power functions; muscle tone functions; control
of voluntary movement functions; changing basic body position; maintaining
a body position; and transferring oneself. The most frequent intervention
goals for cardiopulmonary patients were: functions of the cardiovascular
system; and respiration functions. The most frequent intervention
goals in patients with musculoskeletal conditions were: sensation
of pain; stability of joint functions; muscle power functions; muscle
tone functions; and muscle endurance functions.Conclusion<br/>By
using the ICF as a framework and linguistic support, intervention
goals can serve as standardised documentation for physiotherapy interventions,
their evaluation and planning.</p>},

abstract = {Problem: Evidence is quantified by statistical methods such as p-values and Bayesian posterior probabilities in a routine way despite the fact that there is no consensus about the meanings and implications of these approaches. A high level of confusion about these methods can be observed among students, researchers and even professional statisticians. How can a constructivist view of mathematical models and reality help to resolve the confusion? Method: Considerations about the foundations of statistics and probability are revisited with a constructivist attitude that explores which ways of thinking about the modelled phenomena are implied by different approaches to probability modelling. Results: The understanding of the implications of probability modelling for the quantification of evidence can be strongly improved by accepting that whether models are “true” or not cannot be checked from the data, and the use of the models should rather be justified and critically discussed in terms of their implications for the thinking and communication of researchers. Implications: Some useful questions that researchers can use as guidelines when deciding which approach and which model to choose are listed in the paper, along with some implications of using frequentist p-values or Bayesian posterior probability, which can help to address the questions. It is the – far too often ignored – responsibility of the researchers to decide which model is chosen and what the evidence suggests rather than letting the results decide themselves in an “objective way.”},

abstract = {Lecturers, click here to request an e-inspection copy of this text Watch Andy Field's introductory video to Discovering Statistics Using R Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-deprecating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field's books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioural sciences throughout the world. The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you're doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect. Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more at: Instructor Site. Given this book's accessibility, fun spirit, and use of bizarre real-world research it should be essential for anyone wanting to learn about statistics using the freely-available R software.},

Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

Recalibration of the transformation relating awareness and actions was found to occur over long-term changes in physiological potential (fitness level, age, and health) but not with transitory changes (fatigue and load).

abstract = {'In this brilliant new edition Andy Field has introduced important new introductory material on statistics that the student will need and was missing at least in the first edition. This book is the best blend that I know of a textbook in statistics and a manual on SPSS. It is a balanced composite of both topics, using SPSS to illustrate important statistical material and, through graphics, to make visible important approaches to data analysis. There are many places in the book where I had to laugh, and that's saying a lot for a book on statistics. His excellent style engages the reader and makes reading about statistics fun' - David C Howell, Professor Emeritus, University of Vermont USA This award-winning text, now fully updated with SPSS Statistics, is the only book on statistics that you will need! Fully revised and restructured, this new edition is even more accessible as it now takes students through from introductory to advanced level concepts, all the while grounding knowledge through the use of SPSS Statistics. Andy Field's humorous and self-deprecating style and the book's host of characters make the journey entertaining as well as educational. While still providing a very comprehensive collection of statistical methods, tests and procedures, and packed with examples and self-assessment tests to reinforce knowledge, the new edition now also offers: - a more gentle introduction to basic-level concepts and methods for beginners - new textbook features to make the book more user-friendly for those learning about more advanced concepts, encouraging 'critical thinking' - a brand new, full-colour design, making it easy for students to navigate between topics, and to understand how to use the latest version of SPSS Statistics - both 'real world' (the bizarre and the wonderful) and invented examples illustrate the concepts and make the techniques come alive for students - an additional chapter on multilevel modelling for advanced-level students - reinforced binding to make the book easier to handle at a computer workstation. The book also includes access to a brand new and improved companion Website, bursting with features including: - animated 'SPSS walk-through' videos clearly demonstrating how to use the latest SPSS Statistics modules - self-marking multiple choice questions - data sets for psychology, business and management and health sciences - a flash-card glossary for testing knowledge of key concepts - access to support material from SAGE study skills books. Statistics lecturers are also provided with a whole range of resources and teaching aids, including: - the test bank - over 300 multiple-choice questions ready to upload to WebCT, Blackboard or other virtual learning environments - charts and diagrams in electronic format for inclusion in lecture slides - PowerPoint slides written by the author to accompany chapters of the text.},

abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

abstract = {This article is the second in the series on unidimensional unfolding. Its aim was to test the quantitative component of Coombs's (1964) theory via an empirical application to subjective control in gambling behavior (Dickerson and Baron, 2000). It was found that approximately 96% of judgments upon bilateral stimulus pairs were as predicted by the theory of unidimensional unfolding. The double cancellation axiom of the theory of axiomatic conjoint measurement (ACM) (Krantz, Luce, Suppes and Tversky, 1971) was satisfied by the interstimulus midpoint order obtained from these judgments. These results supported previous unfolding studies on attitudes (Johnson, 2001; Michell, 1994). Exponential and linear relationships were found between the transformed scaling solutions of Coombs's (1964) theory and the SHCMpp (Andrich, 1995). The implications of these results were discussed. Additionally, the article presented both a formal theory of item construction (Michell, 1994) and an accessible demonstration of the Goode's algorithm scaling procedure.},

an international terminology for nursing practice [International
Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP)] that can be useful to
catalogue the problems of a nursing nature in diagnosis and also
find a system for the classification of nursing activities. ICNP
is also the reason why the Italian association Consociazione, representing
Italian Nurses at ICN, through the School of Advanced Nursing of
the University 'La Sapienza' of Rome, has set up a working group
for the translation and experimentation of the ICNP version Beta
2. CONTENT In this article the ICNP beta translation and validation
into Italian is considered with some scenarios of how benefit could
be derived by its utilization for nursing's visibility. The visibility
of nursing care can be measured not only through patient outcomes
but also by studying the existing data of patient care documentation.
To have a common language and terminology in nursing is important
for a universal understanding. RESULTS Some philosophical reasoning
on the genesis and development of ICNP is discussed along with arguments
for and against nursing classification systems. Some findings on
Italian experimentation for nursing documentation as well as economical
analysis are reported along with a vision for future development
and utilization.},

We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.},

positive, and affectively mixed film clips. Although there were no
condition (mindfulness vs. control) effects on reports of emotional
response or difficulties in regulation after the distressing film
clip, participants in the mindfulness condition reported significantly
greater positive affect in response to the positive film. Additionally,
participants in the mindfulness condition reported more adaptive
regulation (approaching significance, medium to large effect size)
in response to the affectively mixed clip and significantly less
negative affect immediately after this clip, although not after a
recovery period. No significant differences emerged between conditions
on physiological measures (skin conductance and heart rate) throughout

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychometric validity and reliability of the incident reporting culture questionnaire (IRCQ; in Chinese) following an exploration of the reporting culture perceived by hospital nurses in Taiwan. DESIGN: Scale development with psychometric examination and a cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ten teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1064 nurses participated with an average response rate of 83% between November 2008 and June 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The factorial construct, criterion-related validity, homogeneity and stability of the IRCQ were evaluated. The nurses' perceptions of the IRCQ were also explored. RESULTS: The four-factor structure of the 20-item IRCQ had satisfactory construct validity (explained variance: 49.37%), criterion-related validity (r = 0.42; P = 0.001), reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.83) and stability (3-week-interval correlation: r = 0.80; P = 0.001). These factors included 'application of learning from errors', 'readiness to provide feedback on incident reports', 'collegial atmospheres of unpleasantness and punishment' (CA) and 'incident management: confidential and system driven'. The nurses perceived a moderate overall reporting culture (mean positive response = 49.25%; range: 67.2-24.94%). They weakly agreed on the CA factor of five items (mean positive response = 24.94%; range: 33.0-17.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence for the psychometric properties of the IRCQ and the reporting culture which nurses perceive in Taiwan. To Taiwanese nurses, the reporting culture within their work environments especially as it relates to coworker relations, inter-professional collaboration and non-punitive atmosphere is their major concern. Healthcare administrators should consider nurses' perceptions related to incident reporting when managing underreporting issues.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the thought processes involved in statistical problem solving in the broad sense from problem formulation to conclusions. It draws on the literature and in-depth interviews with statistics students and practising statisticians aimed at uncovering their statistical reasoning processes. From these interviews, a four-dimensional framework has been identified for statistical thinking in empirical enquiry. It includes an investigative cycle, an interrogative cycle, types of thinking and dispositions. We have begun to characterise these processes through models that can be used as a basis for thinking tools or frameworks for the enhancement of problem-solving. Tools of this form would complement the mathematical models used in analysis and address areas of the process of statistical investigation that the mathematical models do not, particularly areas requiring the synthesis of problem-contextual and statistical understanding. The central element of published definitions of statistical thinking is "variation". We further discuss the role of variation in the statistical conception of real-world problems, including the search for causes.},

All three studies showed this effect to occur even though the person striving to bask in the glory of a successful source was not involved in the cause of the source's success. Experiment 1 demonstrated the BIRG phenome- non by showing a greater tendency for university students to wear school- identifying apparel after their school's football team had been victorious than nonvictorious. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect by showing that stu- dents used the pronoun we more when describing a victory than a nonvictory of their school's football team. A model was developed asserting that the BIRG response represents an attempt to enhance one's public image. Experiments 2 and 3 indicated, in support of this assertion, that the tendency to proclaim a connection with a positive source was strongest when one's public image was threatened.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a treatment for suicidal behavior and borderline personality disorder with well-documented efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that unique aspects of DBT are more efficacious compared with treatment offered by non-behavioral psychotherapy experts.

DESIGN: One-year randomized controlled trial, plus 1 year of posttreatment follow-up.

SETTING: University outpatient clinic and community practice.

PARTICIPANTS: One hundred one clinically referred women with recent suicidal and self-injurious behaviors meeting DSM-IV criteria, matched to condition on age, suicide attempt history, negative prognostic indication, and number of lifetime intentional self-injuries and psychiatric hospitalizations.

INTERVENTION: One year of DBT or 1 year of community treatment by experts (developed to maximize internal validity by controlling for therapist sex, availability, expertise, allegiance, training and experience, consultation availability, and institutional prestige).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trimester assessments of suicidal behaviors, emergency services use, and general psychological functioning. Measures were selected based on previous outcome studies of DBT. Outcome variables were evaluated by blinded assessors.

RESULTS: Dialectical behavior therapy was associated with better outcomes in the intent-to-treat analysis than community treatment by experts in most target areas during the 2-year treatment and follow-up period. Subjects receiving DBT were half as likely to make a suicide attempt (hazard ratio, 2.66; P = .005), required less hospitalization for suicide ideation (F(1,92) = 7.3; P = .004), and had lower medical risk (F(1,50) = 3.2; P = .04) across all suicide attempts and self-injurious acts combined. Subjects receiving DBT were less likely to drop out of treatment (hazard ratio, 3.2; P < .001) and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations (F(1,92) = 6.0; P = .007) and psychiatric emergency department visits (F(1,92) = 2.9; P = .04).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings replicate those of previous studies of DBT and suggest that the effectiveness of DBT cannot reasonably be attributed to general factors associated with expert psychotherapy. Dialectical behavior therapy appears to be uniquely effective in reducing suicide attempts.},

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support a two-factor solution, corresponding to the two constituent components of the construct. Good internal consistency was demonstrated, and relationships with other constructs were largely as expected. As predicted, significant differences were found between the nonclinical and clinical samples in levels of awareness and acceptance. The awareness and acceptance subscales were not correlated, suggesting that these two constructs can be examined independently. Potential theoretical and applied uses of the measure are discussed.},

abstract = {The present study examined whether discrepancies between explicit and implicit self-esteem are associated with symptom severity in a sample of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). We hypothesized that implicit-explicit self-esteem discrepancies foster autoaggressive behavior and dysphoria, and impair self-perception. We found that the two forms of self-esteem discrepancies, damaged and fragile self-esteem were related to the severity of overall borderline symptoms, autoaggression, dysphoria, and deficits in self-perception. In contrast, more general psychopathological impairment, such as depression, was not related to self-esteem discrepancies. Taken together our results indicate that discrepancies between explicit and implicit self-esteem are associated with certain borderline symptoms that may be based on internal tension. The findings can be interpreted within the framework of self-discrepancies and dichotomous attitudes in patients with BPD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Have these calls for change had an impact on the statistical reporting practices in conservation biology? In 2000 and 2001, 92% of sampled articles in Conservation Biology and Biological Conservation reported results of null-hypothesis tests. In 2005 this figure dropped to 78%. There were corresponding increases in the use of confidence intervals, information theoretic, and Bayesian techniques. Of those articles reporting null-hypothesis testing--which still easily constitute the majority--very few report statistical power (8%) and many misinterpret statistical nonsignificance as evidence for no effect (63%). Overall, results of our survey show some improvements in statistical practice, but further efforts are clearly required to move the discipline toward improved practices.},

Hoffrage's (1995) ecological framework, the authors wrote a computerized tutorial program to train people to construct frequency representations (representation training) rather than to insert probabilities into Bayes's rule (rule training). Bayesian computations are simpler to perform with natural frequencies than with probabilities, and there are evolutionary reasons for assuming that cognitive algorithms have been developed to deal with natural frequencies. In 2 studies, the authors compared representation training with rule training; the criteria were an immediate learning effect, transfer to new problems, and long-term temporal stability. Rule training was as good in transfer as representation training, but representation training had a higher immediate learning effect and greater temporal stability.},

abstract = {A three-stimulus auditory oddball series was presented to experienced Vipassana meditators during meditation and a control thought period to elicit event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in the two different mental states. The stimuli consisted of a frequent standard tone (500 Hz), an infrequent oddball tone (1000 Hz), and an infrequent distracter (white noise), with all stimuli passively presented through headphones and no task imposed. The strongest meditation compared to control state effects occurred for the distracter stimuli: N1 amplitude from the distracter was reduced frontally during meditation; P2 amplitude from both the distracter and oddball stimuli were somewhat reduced during meditation; P3a amplitude from the distracter was reduced during meditation. The meditation-induced reduction in P3a amplitude was strongest in participants reporting more hours of daily meditation practice and was not evident in participants reporting drowsiness during their experimental meditative session. The findings suggest that meditation state can decrease the amplitude of neurophysiologic processes that subserve attentional engagement elicited by unexpected and distracting stimuli. Consistent with the aim of Vipassana meditation to reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity, the state effect of reduced P3a amplitude to distracting stimuli reflects decreased automated reactivity and evaluative processing of task irrelevant attention-demanding stimuli.},

In study 2 adult females (n = 190; mean age = 26 yrs) completed
the same measures as in study 1 with the addition of the Barratt
Impulsivity Scale. In both studies it was predicted that mindfulness
would be negatively related to trait disinhibition controlling for
adverse psychological symptoms. The second study addressed the additional
hypothesis that the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition
would be mediated by impulsivity. Regression analyses indicated that
mindfulness was negatively related to and explained 11% of variation
in trait disinhibition (study 1). This relationship was replicated
and extended in study 2 whereby impulsivity mediated the relationship
between mindfulness and trait disinhibition. The findings warrant
experimental and in vivo investigations of the potential causal relationships

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with client perceptions of the quality of primary care services in Afghanistan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of outpatient health facilities, health workers, patients and caretakers. SETTING: Primary health care facilities in every province of Afghanistan. Main outcome measure Numerical scale of client perceptions of service quality. RESULTS: Clients report relatively high levels of perceived quality in Afghanistan. Most of the variation that is explained relates specifically to the patient's interaction with the health worker and not to other health facility characteristics, such as cleanliness, infrastructure, service capacity and the presence of equipment or drugs. The strongest determinants of client-perceived quality identified are health worker thoroughness in taking patient histories, conducting physical examinations and communicating with patients. Being seen by a doctor and being from a household in the poorest quintile are also associated with higher perceived quality. For female patients, being seen by a female provider is associated with higher perceived quality, while for male patients time and money spent for travel to the health facility are negatively associated with perceived quality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical quality and client perceived quality appear to be mutually reinforcing, and efforts to improve health worker performance in taking histories, conducting exams and communicating with patients are likely to increase client perceived quality in this setting. Client perceptions of service quality assume additional importance in Afghanistan, where the perceived legitimacy of the government may depend partially on its ability to convince the population that it can deliver essential health services.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Few studies described nursing diagnosis classification
criteria and how classifications meet these criteria. OBJECTIVES
The purpose was to identify criteria for nursing diagnosis classifications
and to assess how these criteria are met by different classifications.
DESIGN/METHODS First, a literature review was conducted (N=50) to
identify criteria for nursing diagnoses classifications and to evaluate
how these criteria are met by the International Classification of
Nursing Practice (ICNP), the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF), the International Nursing Diagnoses
Classification (NANDA), and the Nursing Diagnostic System of the
Centre for Nursing Development and Research (ZEFP). Using literature
review based general and specific criteria, the principal investigator
evaluated each classification, applying a matrix. Second, a convenience
sample of 20 nursing experts from different Swiss care institutions
answered standardized interview forms, querying current national
and international classification state and use. RESULTS The first
general criterion is that a diagnosis classification should describe
the knowledge base and subject matter for which the nursing profession
is responsible. ICNP) and NANDA meet this goal. The second general
criterion is that each class fits within a central concept. The ICF
and NANDA are the only two classifications built on conceptually
driven classes. The third general classification criterion is that
each diagnosis possesses a description, diagnostic criteria, and
related etiologies. Although ICF and ICNP describe diagnostic terms,
only NANDA fulfils this criterion. The analysis indicated that NANDA
fulfilled most of the specific classification criteria in the matrix.
The nursing experts considered NANDA to be the best-researched and
most widely implemented classification in Switzerland and internationally.
CONCLUSIONS The international literature and the opinion of Swiss
expert nurses indicate that-from the perspective of classifying comprehensive
nursing diagnoses-NANDA should be recommended for nursing practice
and electronic nursing documentation. Study limitations and future
research needs are discussed.},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} To investigate potential sources of systematic bias arising in the assessment of doctors' professionalism.\n{DESIGN:} Linear regression modelling of cross sectional questionnaire survey data.\n{SETTING:} 11 clinical practices in England and Wales. {PARTICIPANTS:} 1065 non-training grade doctors from various clinical specialties and settings, 17,031 of their colleagues, and 30,333 of their patients. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES:} Two measures of a doctor's professional performance using patient and colleague questionnaires from the United Kingdom's General Medical Council ({GMC).} We selected potential predictor variables from the characteristics of the doctors and of their patient and colleague assessors.\n{RESULTS:} After we adjusted for characteristics of the doctor as well as characteristics of the patient sample, less favourable scores from patient feedback were independently predicted by doctors having obtained their primary medical degree from any non-European country; doctors practising as a psychiatrist; lower proportions of white patients providing feedback; lower proportions of patients rating their consultation as being very important; and lower proportions of patients reporting that they were seeing their usual doctor. Lower scores from colleague feedback were independently predicted by doctors having obtained their primary medical degree from countries outside the {UK} and South Asia; currently employed in a locum capacity; working as a general practitioner or psychiatrist; being employed in a staff grade, associate specialist, or other equivalent role; and with a lower proportion of colleagues reporting they had daily or weekly professional contact with the doctor. In fully adjusted models, the doctor's age, sex, and ethnic group were not independent predictors of patient or colleague feedback. Neither the age or sex profiles of the patient or colleague samples were independent predictors of doctors' feedback scores, and nor was the ethnic group of colleague samples. {CONCLUSIONS:} Caution is necessary when considering patient and colleague feedback regarding doctors' professionalism. Multisource feedback undertaken for revalidation using the {GMC} patient and colleague questionnaires should, at least initially, be principally formative in nature.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of creating a valid and reliable checklist with the following features: appropriate for assessing both randomised and non-randomised studies; provision of both an overall score for study quality and a profile of scores not only for the quality of reporting, internal validity (bias and confounding) and power, but also for external validity. DESIGN: A pilot version was first developed, based on epidemiological principles, reviews, and existing checklists for randomised studies. Face and content validity were assessed by three experienced reviewers and reliability was determined using two raters assessing 10 randomised and 10 non-randomised studies. Using different raters, the checklist was revised and tested for internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson 20), test-retest and inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient and sign rank test; kappa statistics), criterion validity, and respondent burden. MAIN RESULTS: The performance of the checklist improved considerably after revision of a pilot version. The Quality Index had high internal consistency (KR-20: 0.89) as did the subscales apart from external validity (KR-20: 0.54). Test-retest (r 0.88) and inter-rater (r 0.75) reliability of the Quality Index were good. Reliability of the subscales varied from good (bias) to poor (external validity). The Quality Index correlated highly with an existing, established instrument for assessing randomised studies (r 0.90). There was little difference between its performance with non-randomised and with randomised studies. Raters took about 20 minutes to assess each paper (range 10 to 45 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that it is feasible to develop a checklist that can be used to assess the methodological quality not only of randomised controlled trials but also non-randomised studies. It has also shown that it is possible to produce a checklist that provides a profile of the paper, alerting reviewers to its particular methodological strengths and weaknesses. Further work is required to improve the checklist and the training of raters in the assessment of external validity.},

abstract = {Ninety-nine knees in 81 patients evaluated from two to ten years and
having enough valgus deformity to require specific soft-tissue release
were studied. They were also compared to a control group of 40 knees
in 31 patients with no angular deformity greater than 5 degrees,
who were matched for age and diagnosis. All procedures were performed
using a minimally constrained, posterior-cruciate-ligament-sparing
prosthesis. Pre- and postoperative axial alignment was measured on
weight-bearing long-standing roentgenographs. Analysis included examination
for lucent lines in postoperative fluoroscopically positioned roentgenographs
and clinical data summarized using the 100-point scoring systems
developed by The Knee Society. Knees were classified as having Type
I, II, or III valgus deformities: Type I was defined as valgus deformity
secondary to bone loss in the lateral compartment and soft-tissue
contracture with medial soft tissues intact; Type II was defined
as obvious attenuation of the medial capsular ligament complex; and
Type III was defined as severe valgus deformity with valgus malpositioning
of the proximal tibial joint line after overcorrected proximal tibial
osteotomy. Only cases of Type I and Type II were represented in the
99 knees reported. Type I patients were treated with lateral soft-tissue
release, and Type II patients were treated with medial capsular ligament
tightening (i.e., ligament reconstruction procedures on the medial
side). The Knee Society postoperative knee score was 87.6 (+/- 10.6)
and mean postoperative functional score was 52.3. Alignment was well
corrected and knee scores for the Type I and II groups were almost
identical as were the functional scores. The results were grouped
as 72% excellent, 18% good, 7% fair, and 2% poor. Notably, the control
group was 39 of 40 patients excellent, and only one poor. Ligament
stability was satisfactorily established by lateral release in Type
I and with the combined medial plication in the Type II patients.
The ligament-tightening procedures were on the average 40 minutes
longer than those for the Type I or the control groups. The controversial
nature of the simultaneous ligament reconstruction method is recognized,
but good experience is reported.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: ADHD is a childhood-onset psychiatric condition that often continues into adulthood. Stimulant medications are the mainstay of treatment; however, additional approaches are frequently desired. In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been proposed to improve attention, reduce stress, and improve mood. This study tests the feasibility of an 8-week mindfulness training program for adults and adolescents with ADHD.

METHOD: Twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with ADHD enrolled in a feasibility study of an 8-week mindfulness training program.

RESULTS: The majority of participants completed the training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre-post improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted. Improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms were also observed.

CONCLUSION: Mindfulness training is a feasible intervention in a subset of ADHD adults and adolescents and may improve behavioral and neurocognitive impairments. A controlled clinical study is warranted.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a program that has been shown to be beneficial for clinical and non-clinical populations. While much attention has been paid to participants' outcomes, little work has been published concerning processes underlying improvements. Herein, women who had finished medical treatment for breast cancer completed questionnaires pre- and post-MBSR and were interviewed using focus group methodology such that quantitative and qualitative data were combined to explore potential mechanisms underlying changes. It was found that the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale was a useful process measure to assess changes in mindfulness and that the Coping with Health Injuries and Problems questionnaire was useful in documenting changes in palliative (self-care) coping over the course of the 8 week program. Moreover, the Sense of Coherence questionnaire suggested that the women viewed life as more meaningful and manageable following MSBR. Our findings fit with Shapiro et al.'s theory that, over time, participants in an MBSR program "reperceive" what they encounter in their daily experiences.},

@article{Gargouri2010,
abstract = {Background Articles whose authors have supplemented subscription-based access to the publisher's version by self-archiving their own final draft to make it accessible free for all on the web (“Open Access”, OA) are cited significantly more than articles in the same journal and year that have not been made OA. Some have suggested that this “OA Advantage” may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles OA. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002–2006 in 1,984 journals.  Methdology/Principal Findings The OA Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression analysis showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and highest for the most highly cited articles. The OA Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20% of articles receive about 80% of all citations).  Conclusions/Significance The OA advantage is greater for the more citable articles, not because of a quality bias from authors self-selecting what to make OA, but because of a quality advantage, from users self-selecting what to use and cite, freed by OA from the constraints of selective accessibility to subscribers only. It is hoped that these findings will help motivate the adoption of OA self-archiving mandates by universities, research institutions and research funders.},

@article{Grossman2007c,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) proposes a systematic program for reduction of suffering associated with a wide range of medical conditions. Studies suggest improvements in general aspects of well-being, including quality of life (QoL), coping and positive affect, as well as decreased anxiety and depression.

METHODS: A quasi-experimental study examined effects of an 8-week MBSR intervention among 58 female patients with fibromyalgia (mean, 52 +/- 8 years) who underwent MBSR or an active social support procedure. Participants were assigned to groups by date of entry, and 6 subjects dropped out during the study. Self-report measures were validated German inventories and included the following scales: visual analog pain, pain perception, coping with pain, a symptom checklist and QoL. Pre- and postintervention measurements were made. Additionally, a 3-year follow-up was carried out on a subgroup of 26 participants.

RESULTS: Pre- to postintervention analyses indicated MBSR to provide significantly greater benefits than the control intervention on most dimensions, including visual analog pain, QoL subscales, coping with pain, anxiety, depression and somatic complaints (Cohen d effect size, 0.40-1.10). Three-year follow-up analyses of MBSR participants indicated sustained benefits for these same measures (effect size, 0.50-0.65).

CONCLUSIONS: Based upon a quasi-randomized trial and long-term observational follow-up, results indicate mindfulness intervention to be of potential long-term benefit for female fibromyalgia patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To describe functioning and health of elderly patients in
an early post-acute rehabilitation facility and to identify the most
common problems using the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF). METHODS Cross-sectional survey in a
convenience sample of elderly patients requiring rehabilitation in
an early post-acute rehabilitation facility. The second-level categories
of the ICF were used to collect information on patients' problems.
For the ICF components Body Functions, Body Structures and Activities
and Participation, absolute and relative frequencies of impairments/limitations
in the study population were reported. For the component Environmental
Factors absolute and relative frequencies of perceived barriers or
facilitators were reported. RESULTS The mean age in the sample was
79.9 years. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were female. In 150
patients, 82 ICF categories (34%) had a prevalence of 30% or above.
The 82 categories included 22 categories (45%) of the component Body
Functions, six categories (15%) of the component Body Structures,
25 categories (34%) of the component Activities and Participation
and 29 (57%) categories of the component Environmental Factors. CONCLUSION
This study is a first step towards the development of ICF Core Sets
for geriatric patients in early post-acute rehabilitation facilities.},

The psychophysics of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss. The relationships between decision values and experience values and between hedonic experience and objective states are discussed.},

@article{Sedlmeier2012a,
abstract = {In this meta-analysis, we give a comprehensive overview of the effects of meditation on psychological variables that can be extracted from empirical studies, concentrating on the effects of meditation on nonclinical groups of adult meditators. Mostly because of methodological problems, almost ¾ of an initially identified 595 studies had to be excluded. Most studies appear to have been conducted without sufficient theoretical background. To put the results into perspective, we briefly summarize the major theoretical approaches from both East and West. The 163 studies that allowed the calculation of effect sizes exhibited medium average effects (r = .28 for all studies and r = .27 for the n = 125 studies from reviewed journals), which cannot be explained by mere relaxation or cognitive restructuring effects. In general, results were strongest (medium to large) for changes in emotionality and relationship issues, less strong (about medium) for measures of attention, and weakest (small to medium) for more cognitive measures. However, specific findings varied across different approaches to meditation (transcendental meditation, mindfulness meditation, and other meditation techniques). Surprisingly, meditation experience only partially covaried with long-term impact on the variables examined. In general, the dependent variables used cover only some of the content areas about which predictions can be made from already existing theories about meditation; still, such predictions lack precision at present. We conclude that to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of why and how meditation works, emphasis should be placed on the development of more precise theories and measurement devices.},

@article{Lisse2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity mediated by dual cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause serious alterations of mucosal integrity or, more commonly, intolerable GI symptoms that may necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Unlike NSAIDs, rofecoxib targets only the COX-2 isoform.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability of rofecoxib compared with naproxen for treatment of osteoarthritis.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.

SETTING: 600 office and clinical research sites.

PATIENTS: 5557 patients (mean age, 63 years) with a baseline diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, hand, or spine.

INTERVENTION: Rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, or naproxen, 500 mg twice daily. Use of routine medications, including aspirin, was permitted.

MEASUREMENTS: Discontinuation due to GI adverse events (primary end point) and use of concomitant medication to treat GI symptoms (secondary end point). Efficacy was determined by patient-reported global assessment of disease status and the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index, as well as discontinuations due to lack of efficacy. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12.

RESULTS: Rates of cumulative discontinuation due to GI adverse events were statistically significantly lower in the rofecoxib group than in the naproxen group (5.9% vs. 8.1%; relative risk, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92]; P = 0.005), as were rates of cumulative use of medication to treat GI symptoms (9.1% vs. 11.2%; relative risk, 0.79 [CI, 0.66 to 0.96]; P = 0.014]). Subgroup analysis of patients who used low-dose aspirin (13%) and those who previously discontinued using arthritis medication because of GI symptoms (15%) demonstrated a relative risk similar to the overall sample for discontinuation due to GI adverse events (relative risk, 0.56 [CI, 0.31 to 1.01] and 0.53 [CI, 0.34 to 0.84], respectively). No statistically significant difference was observed between treatments for efficacy in treating osteoarthritis or for occurrence of other adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with osteoarthritis treated for 12 weeks, rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, was as effective as naproxen, 500 mg twice daily, but had statistically significantly superior GI tolerability and led to less use of concomitant GI medications. Benefits of rofecoxib in subgroup analyses were consistent with findings in the overall sample.},

abstract = {Background: Individual trials have suggested high levels of general
patient satisfaction with intermediate care, but this topic has not
been examined in detail.Aims: To identify the key elements of patient
satisfaction with intermediate care, and to see whether these can
be validly measured using a questionnaire.Method: A questionnaire
was developed on the basis of a literature review and piloting with
patients and staff on participating schemes (phase I). In phase II,
the questionnaire was tested for validity and reliability in a group
of patients recently discharged from two “hospital-at-home��? intermediate-care
schemes. In phase III, a shortened version of the questionnaire was
psychometrically tested in five sites taking part in a national evaluation
of intermediate care.Results: 96 patients with an average age of
76.5 years took part in phase II. Test–retest reliability was evaluated
by repeating the questionnaire 2 weeks later in a subsample of 42
patients. This was “moderate��? ($\kappa$ 0.4–0.6) for 12 questions,
“fair��? ($\kappa$ 0.2–0.4) for 6 questions and “poor��? ($\kappa$ 0.1–0.2)
for 5 questions. Scores correlated well with the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire (Spearman's r = 0.75, p<0.001). 843 patients
(57% of those eligible) from five intermediate-care schemes took
part in phase III. Principal components analysis suggested six factors
or subscales: general satisfaction, affective response, cognitive
response, timing of discharge, coordination after discharge, and
access to pain relief, although the last three factors comprised
only one question each. The intraclass correlation coefficients in
the first three subscales varied from 0.82 to 0.89. Scores for all
subscales differed by scheme, suggesting construct validity. Only
one question (on general satisfaction) was found to be redundant.Conclusion:
The questionnaire, with some minor amendments to improve performance,
could be used as a validated tool for audit and research in intermediate
care. An amended version and scoring programme is available from
us on request.},

and clinical utility of the beta version of the ICNP in the context
of standardized nursing care planning in a clinical setting. METHODS
An 35-bed acute care ward for infectious diseases at a Swedish university
hospital was selected for clinical testing. A convenience sample
of 56 patient records with data on nutrition and skin care was analyzed
and mapped to the ICNP. FINDINGS Using the ICNP terminology, 59%-62%
of the record content describing nursing phenomena and 30%-44% of
the nursing interventions in the areas of nutrition and skin care
could be expressed satisfactorily. For about a quarter of the content
describing nursing phenomena and interventions, no corresponding
ICNP term was found. CONCLUSIONS The ICNP needs to be further developed
to allow representation of the entire range of nursing care. Terms
need to be developed to express patient participation and preferences,
normal conditions, qualitative dimensions and characteristics, nonhuman
focus, and duration. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS The practical usefulness
of the ICNP needs further testing before conclusions about its clinical
benefits can be determined.},

This is crucial for practical applications. In this book, I first define the problem in order to provide an abstraction or structure to the problem. From the abstraction, we will naturally see its key sub-problems. The subsequent chapters discuss the existing techniques for solving these subproblems.},

In this predicament it has been observed that minimal requests, while serving to make a target person's compliance highly likely, also tend to produce low-level payoffs for the requester. A procedure was developed to avoid the dilemma by legitimizing, rather than requesting, the delivery of a minimal favor. It was predicted that a solicitor who implied that a very small favor was acceptable, but not necessarily desirable, would make it difficult for a target to decline to help and, at the same time, make it unlikely that the target would actually offer a low grade of assistance. In confirmation of this prediction, a door-to-door solicitor for charity was able to increase significantly the frequency of donations while leaving unaffected the size of the donations by adding the sentence, "Even a penny will help," to a standard request for funds. Exp II replicated this result and provided evidence for the legitimization-of-small-favors explanation of the effect.},

Factor analysis identified 3 separate dimensions of satisfaction, which pertained to the visit itself, to access and to general attitude toward the ECO. Validation tests were consistent with expectations. In multivariate analysis, older patient age and greater perceived treatment effectiveness predicted independently all satisfaction scales. Presence of a mixed physical and mental problem reduced satisfaction with the visit itself only, a delay between the phone call and the visit exceeding one hour reduced satisfaction with access and worsened the attitude toward the ECO.; Conclusion: The instrument used to measure patient satisfaction with emergency house calls performed well. Overall levels of satisfaction were high. Perceived effectiveness of treatment was the strongest correlate of patient satisfaction. Monitoring of patient satisfaction in emergency settings may contribute to improvements of quality of care.; },

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine scale dimensionality,
reliability, invariance, targeting, continuity, cutoff scores, and
diagnostic use of the Geriatric Depression Scale–Short Form (GDS-SF)
over time with a sample of 177 English-speaking U.S. elders. Design
and Methods: An item response theory, Rasch analysis, was conducted
with data from a larger study that implemented 3 interventions and
collected data at 3 time points (prior to intervention, after intervention,
and a year following the end of intervention). Results: A unidimensional
structure was found in this study to adequately fit the data. There
appears to be significant differential item functioning, with up
to one third of the items indicating that the items have different
meanings for different groups of participants. As a screening tool,
the GDS-SF is more likely to discriminate between older adults who
have a “moderate��? level of depression than between those with
mild depression and no diagnosed depression. Implications: We would
recommend that the GDS-SF not be used as the sole method of screening
for depression but incorporated into other clinical knowledge related
to the geriatric patient in question, given that not all items are
equally functional. The GDS-SF may be less effective as a screening
tool but could be better used to detect a change in moderate levels
of depression. Clinicians may also benefit by identifying person
responses that misfit. If an individual provides responses that are
atypical, the person might be referred to provide a more in-depth
assessment of mental health status.},

@article{Montanari2010,
abstract = {Classical factor analysis relies on the assumption of normally distributed
factors that guarantees the model to be estimated via the maximum
likelihood method. Even when the assumption of Gaussian factors is
not explicitly formulated and estimation is performed via the iterated
principal factors' method, the interest is actually mainly focussed
on the linear structure of the data, since only moments up to the
second ones are involved. In many real situations, the factors could
not be adequately described by the first two moments only. For example,
skewness characterizing most latent variables in social analysis
can be properly measured by the third moment: the factors are not
normally distributed and covariance is no longer a sufficient statistic.
In this work we propose a factor model characterized by skew-normally
distributed factors. Skew-normal refers to a parametric class of
probability distributions, that extends the normal distribution by
an additional shape parameter regulating the skewness. The model
estimation can be solved by the generalized EM algorithm, in which
the iterative Newthon-Raphson procedure is needed in the M-step to
estimate the factor shape parameter. The proposed skew-normal factor
analysis is applied to the study of student satisfaction towards
university courses, in order to identify the factors representing
different aspects of the latent overall satisfaction.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to apply a novel economic tool (cost satisfaction analysis) to assess the utility of fixed prosthodontics, to review its applicability, and to explore the perceived value of treatment. The cost satisfaction analysis employed the validated Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). Patients with a known prostheses outcome over 1-20 years were mailed the PSQ. Five hundred patients (50{\textperiodcentered}7%) responded. Remembered satisfaction at insertion (initial costs) and current satisfaction (costs in hindsight) were reported on VAS, and the difference calculated (costs with time). Percentage and grouped responses (low, <40%; medium, 40-70%; high, > 70%) were analysed in relation to patient gender, age and willingness to have undergone the same treatment again, and in relation to prostheses age, type, complexity and outcome. Significance was set at P = 0{\textperiodcentered}05. Averages were reported as means ± standard error. Satisfaction with initial costs and costs in hindsight were unrelated to patient gender and age, and prostheses age, type and complexity. Patients with a failure and those who would elect to not undergo the same treatment again were significantly less satisfied with initial costs (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}021, P < 0{\textperiodcentered}001) and costs in hindsight (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}021, P < 0{\textperiodcentered}001) than their counterparts. Patient's cost satisfaction (entire cohort) had significantly improved from 53 ± 1% at insertion to 81 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}9% in hindsight (28 ± 1% improvement, P < 0{\textperiodcentered}001). Patient cost satisfaction had also significantly improved, and the magnitude of improvement was the same within every individual cohort (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}004 to P < 0{\textperiodcentered}001), including patients with failures, and those who in hindsight would not undergo the same treatment again. Low satisfaction was reported by 166 patients initially, but 94% of these reported improvements in hindsight. Fourteen patients (3%) remained dissatisfied in hindsight, although 71% of these would still choose to undergo the same treatment again. Cost satisfaction analysis provided an evaluation of the patient's perspective of the value of fixed prosthodontic treatment. Although fixed prosthodontic treatment was perceived by patients to be expensive, it was also perceived to impart value with time. Cost satisfaction analysis provides a clinically useful insight into patient behaviour.},

the change perceptions displayed differential relationships with
outcomes. Discussion focuses on the importance of systematically

abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class.

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. 1.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prediction of breast cancer survivability has been a challenging research problem for many researchers. Since the early dates of the related research, much advancement has been recorded in several related fields. For instance, thanks to innovative biomedical technologies, better explanatory prognostic factors are being measured and recorded; thanks to low cost computer hardware and software technologies, high volume better quality data is being collected and stored automatically; and finally thanks to better analytical methods, those voluminous data is being processed effectively and efficiently. Therefore, the main objective of this manuscript is to report on a research project where we took advantage of those available technological advancements to develop prediction models for breast cancer survivability.

METHODS AND MATERIAL: We used two popular data mining algorithms (artificial neural networks and decision trees) along with a most commonly used statistical method (logistic regression) to develop the prediction models using a large dataset (more than 200,000 cases). We also used 10-fold cross-validation methods to measure the unbiased estimate of the three prediction models for performance comparison purposes.

RESULTS: The results indicated that the decision tree (C5) is the best predictor with 93.6% accuracy on the holdout sample (this prediction accuracy is better than any reported in the literature), artificial neural networks came out to be the second with 91.2% accuracy and the logistic regression models came out to be the worst of the three with 89.2% accuracy.

CONCLUSION: The comparative study of multiple prediction models for breast cancer survivability using a large dataset along with a 10-fold cross-validation provided us with an insight into the relative prediction ability of different data mining methods. Using sensitivity analysis on neural network models provided us with the prioritized importance of the prognostic factors used in the study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stretching protocols for elderly people (>
or = 65 years of age) have not been studied to determine the effectiveness
of increasing range of motion (ROM). The purpose of this study was
to determine which of 3 durations of stretches would produce and
maintain the greatest gains in knee extension ROM with the femur
held at 90 degrees of hip flexion in a group of elderly individuals.
SUBJECTS: Sixty-two subjects (mean age = 84.7 years, SD = 5.6, range
= 65-97) with tight hamstring muscles (defined as the inability to
extend the knee to less than 20 degrees of knee flexion) participated.
Subjects were recruited from a retirement housing complex and were
independent in activities of daily living. METHODS: Subjects were
randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups and completed a physical activity
questionnaire. The subjects in group 1 (n = 13, mean age = 85.1 years,
SD = 6.4, range = 70-97), a control group, performed no stretching.
The randomly selected right or left limb of subjects in group 2 (n
= 17, mean age = 85.5 years, SD = 4.5, range = 80-93), group 3 (n
= 15, mean age = 85.2 years, SD = 6.5, range = 65-92), and group
4 (n = 17, mean age = 83.2 years, SD = 4.6, range = 68-90) was stretched
5 times per week for 6 weeks for 15, 30, and 60 seconds, respectively.
Range of motion was measured once a week for 10 weeks to determine
the treatment and residual effects. Data were analyzed using a growth
curve model. RESULTS: A 60-second stretch produced a greater rate
of gains in ROM (60-second stretch = 2.4 degrees per week, 30-second
stretch = 1.3 degrees per week, 15-second stretch = 0.6 degrees per
week), which persisted longer than the gains in any other group (group
4 still had 5.4 degrees more ROM 4 weeks after treatment than at
pretest as compared with 0.7 degrees and 0.8 degrees for groups 2
and 3, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Longer hold times
during stretching of the hamstring muscles resulted in a greater
rate of gains in ROM and a more sustained increase in ROM in elderly
subjects. These results may differ from those of studies performed
with younger populations because of age-related physiologic changes.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). NHST has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

abstract = {Longitudinal study designs in biomedical research are motivated by the need or desire of a researcher to assess the change over time of an outcome and what risk factors may be associated with the outcome. The outcome is measured repeatedly over time for every individual in the study, and risk factors may be measured repeatedly over time or they may be static. For example, many clinical studies involving chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) use pulmonary function as a primary outcome and measure it repeatedly over time for each individual. There are many issues, both practical and theoretical, which make the analysis of longitudinal data complicated. Fortunately, advances in statistical theory and computer tech- nology over the past two decades have made techniques for the analysis of longitudinal data more readily available for data analysts. The aim of this paper is to provide a discussion of the important features of longitudinal data and review two popular modern statistical techniques used in biomedical research for the analy- sis of longitudinal data: the general linear mixed model, and generalized estimating equations. Examples are provided, using the study of pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis research.},

abstract = {Judicial sentencing decisions should be guided by facts, not by chance. The present research however demonstrates that the sentencing decisions of experienced legal professionals are influenced by irrelevant sentencing demands even if they are blatantly determined at random. Participating legal experts anchored their sentencing decisions on a given sentencing demand and assimilated toward it even if this demand came from an irrelevant source (Study 1), they were informed that this demand was randomly determined (Study 2), or they randomly determined this demand themselves by throwing dice (Study 3). Expertise and experience did not reduce this effect. This sentencing bias appears to be produced by a selective increase in the accessibility of arguments that are consistent with the random sentencing demand: The accessibility of incriminating arguments was higher if participants were confronted with a high rather than a low anchor (Study 4). Practical and theoretical implications of this research are discussed.},

abstract = {The scientific interest in meditation and mindfulness practice has recently seen an unprecedented surge. After an initial phase of presenting beneficial effects of mindfulness practice in various domains, research is now seeking to unravel the underlying psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms. Advances in understanding these processes are required for improving and fine-tuning mindfulness-based interventions that target specific conditions such as eating disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. This review presents a theoretical framework that emphasizes the central role of attentional control mechanisms in the development of mindfulness skills. It discusses the phenomenological level of experience during meditation, the different attentional functions that are involved, and relates these to the brain networks that subserve these functions. On the basis of currently available empirical evidence specific processes as to how attention exerts its positive influence are considered and it is concluded that meditation practice appears to positively impact attentional functions by improving resource allocation processes. As a result, attentional resources are allocated more fully during early processing phases which subsequently enhance further processing. Neural changes resulting from a pure form of mindfulness practice that is central to most mindfulness programs are considered from the perspective that they constitute a useful reference point for future research. Furthermore, possible interrelations between the improvement of attentional control and emotion regulation skills are discussed. },

abstract = {Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to document
the prevalence, severity, and progression of knee flexion contractures
(KFCs) in a population of institutionalized elderly and to identify
relationships between knee extension and other variables. Subjects.
The subjects were 112 nursing home residents who exhibited a broad
range of ambulation and cognitive function abilities. Methods. Data
were collected initially (T1) and after a 10-month period (T2). Results.
Only 25% of the population had extension in the 0- to 5-degree (lacking
full extension) range bilaterally at T1 and T2, leaving the majority
of subjects with some degree of unilateral KFC. Most of the subjects
with a KFC greater than 20 degrees were nonambulatory and had a significantly
higher occurrence of resistance to motion than did nonambulators
with a KFC of less than 20 degrees. Knee extension measurements did
not change in most subjects between T1 and T2. The knees that did
show a change in KFC (either an increase or a decrease) had a significantly
higher occurrence of resistance to passive motion than did other
knees. Compared with the subjects who gained extension, the subjects
who lost extension over the study period more frequently had minimal
KFC at T1, were ambulatory at T1, showed a regression in ambulation
at T2, and developed resistance to motion at T2. Conclusion and Discussion.
The data confirmed significant positive correlations between degree
of KFC and presence of resistance to passive knee motion, cognitive
impairment, impaired ambulation, and presence of knee pain. Physical
therapy assessment and intervention may be appropriate in nonambulatory
nursing home residents with resistance to passive motion, residents
with KFC approaching 20 degrees, and ambulatory residents with minimal
KFC who develop resistance and begin to regress in ambulation. Several
areas for future study are suggested.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function are well-established in adults with current depression. HPA alterations may persist into remission and confer increased risk for recurrence.

METHODS: A modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was administered at baseline to 32 young adults with remitted major depressive disorder and 36 never-depressed controls. Participants were randomly assigned to either a 'high-stress' condition involving social evaluation or a 'low-stress' control condition. Cortisol concentrations were measured in saliva samples throughout the TSST. Participants were assessed again after 6 months for the occurrence of stressful life events and depressive symptoms/disorders during the follow-up period.

RESULTS: Participants who exhibited enhanced cortisol reactivity in the low-stress condition showed increases in depressive symptoms over follow-up, after controlling for stressful life events during the follow-up period. Anticipatory stress cortisol and cortisol reactivity each interacted with history of depressive episodes to predict depression trajectories.

LIMITATIONS: The single TSST administration limits conclusions about whether alterations of cortisol reactivity represent trait-like vulnerability factors or consequences ("scars') of past depression.

CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous findings on stress sensitivity in depression and suggest that altered HPA function during remission could reflect an endophenotype for vulnerability to depression recurrence. Findings support interactive models of risk for depression recurrence implicating HPA function, depression history, and sensitivity to minor stressors. Results may have implications for interventions that match treatment approaches to profiles of HPA function.},

abstract = {This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Chronic
Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) in a mixed chronic pain, Internet
sample and sought to develop a valid and reliable short form. Questionnaires
were completed by 428 respondents, comprising a sample accessed via
the Internet (n = 319) and a sample who completed a paper and pencil
version of the measures (n = 109). Using confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) the two-factor structure of the CPAQ in the Internet sample
was supported, though a good model fit was only achieved following
the removal of one item. The resultant 19 item CPAQ demonstrated
good reliability and evidence of validity was obtained for this sample.
Data from the Internet sample were used to derive an eight-item short
form. The two four-item factors (activity engagement [AE] and pain
willingness [PW]) were confirmed using CFA and found to be invariant
across both samples with good scale reliability. Higher CPAQ-8 and
subscale scores were correlated with less depression and anxiety,
pain severity and pain interference, and fewer medical visits for
pain. Using structural equation modelling both subscales were found
to partially mediate the impact of pain severity on pain interference
and emotional distress. In this model AE had stronger associations
with outcomes while PW accounted for a small portion of the variance
in pain interference and anxiety, but not depression. This study
confirmed the two-factor structure of the CPAQ in a mixed chronic
pain Internet sample and provides preliminary evidence for the psychometric
soundness of the CPAQ-8.},

gender roles-that is, of people's beliefs about the behavior that

consistency between role expectations and social behavior, meta-analyses
have examined the moderators and mediators specified by this theoretical
model The outcomes of these moderator and mediator analyses are illustrated
from several meta-analyses of gender and social behavior. These meta-analyses
thus show that quantitative reviewing is not limited to the mere
summarizing of research findings; the technique also allows reviewers
to examine the plausibility of theories that are relevant to these

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contractures are a common complication of neurological
and musculoskeletal conditions, and are characterised by a reduction
in joint mobility. Stretch is widely used for the treatment and prevention
of contractures. However, it is not clear whether stretch is effective.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of stretch on contractures in
people with, or at risk of, contractures. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic
searches were conducted on CENTRAL, DARE, HTA (The Cochrane Library);
MEDLINE; CINAHL; EMBASE; SCI-EXPANDED; and PEDro (April 2009). SELECTION
CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials
of stretch applied for the purpose of treating or preventing contractures
were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary
outcomes of interest were joint mobility and quality of life. The
secondary outcomes were pain, spasticity, activity limitation and
participation restriction. Outcomes were evaluated immediately after
intervention, in the short term (one to seven days) and in the long
term (> one week). Effects were expressed as mean differences or
standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Meta-analyses were conducted with a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS:
Thirty-five studies with 1391 participants met the inclusion criteria.
No study performed stretch for more than seven months. In people
with neurological conditions, there was moderate to high quality
evidence to indicate that stretch does not have clinically important
immediate (mean difference 3 degrees ; 95% CI 0 to 7), short-term
(mean difference 1 degrees ; 95% CI 0 to 3) or long-term (mean difference
0 degrees ; 95% CI -2 to 2) effects on joint mobility. The results
were similar for people with non-neurological conditions. For all
conditions, there is little or no effect of stretch on pain, spasticity,
activity limitation, participation restriction or quality of life.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Stretch does not have clinically important
effects on joint mobility in people with, or at risk of, contractures
if performed for less than seven months. The effects of stretch performed
for periods longer than seven months have not been investigated.},

abstract = {The relationships between personality traits and performance are often assumed to be linear. This assumption has been challenged conceptually and empirically, but results to date have been inconclusive. In the current study, we took a theory-driven approach in systematically addressing this issue. Results based on two different samples generally supported our expectations of the curvilinear relationships between personality traits, including Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability, and job performance dimensions, including task performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behaviors. We also hypothesized and found that job complexity moderated the curvilinear personality–performance relationships such that the inflection points after which the relationships disappear were lower for low-complexity jobs than they were for high-complexity jobs. This finding suggests that high levels of the two personality traits examined are more beneficial for performance in high- than low-complexity jobs. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the use of personality in personnel selection.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify candidate categories for brief International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Sets
for the reporting and measurement of functioning in patients in the
acute hospital. DESIGN Prospective multi-centre cohort study. PATIENTS
Patients receiving rehabilitation interventions for musculoskeletal,
neurological or cardiopulmonary injury or disease in acute hospitals.
METHODS Functioning and contextual factors were coded using the ICF.
The criterion for selecting candidate categories for the brief ICF
Core Sets was based on their ability to discriminate between patients
with high or low functioning status. Discrimination was assessed
using multivariable regression models, the independent variables
being all of the ICF categories of the respective comprehensive ICF
Core Set. Analogue ratings of overall functioning as reported by
patients and health professionals were used as dependent variables.
RESULTS A total of 391 patients were included in the study (91 neurological,
109 cardiopulmonary, 191 musculoskeletal), mean age 63.4 years, 50.1%
female. Selection yielded 33 cate-gories for neurological, 31 for
cardiopulmonary, and 30 for musculoskeletal. CONCLUSION The present
selection of categories can be considered an initial proposal, serving
to identify the ICF cate-gories most relevant for the practical assessment
and monitoring of functioning in patients with acute neurological,
cardiopulmonary, and musculoskeletal conditions.},

In particular, in Italy much attention is being paid to the problem of algal blooms in the Adriatic Sea and this has led also to an increase of interest in mathematical ecology at all levels, from high school teaching to advanced research. The logistic differential equation, dealt with in the next section, is a classical but still useful model for describing the dynamics of a one-species population in and environment with limited resources. For example, the data in Table 1 and Figure 1 represent the time evolution of an algal sample taken in the Adriatic Sea and do seem to follow a logistic curve. We will explore the problem of fitting, in the least-squares sense, a logistic curve (i.e., the solution to the logistic equation) to such a set of measured data.},

abstract = {Biomedical journals and the pharmaceutical industry share the goals of enhancing transparency and expanding access to peer-reviewed research; both industries have recently instituted new policies and guidelines to effect this change. However, while increasing transparency may elevate standards and bring benefits to readers, it will drive a significant increase in manuscript volume, posing challenges to both the journals and industry sponsors. As a result, there is a need to: (1) increase efficiency in the submission process to accommodate the rising manuscript volume and reduce the resource demands on journals, peer reviewers, and authors; and (2) identify suitable venues to publish this research. These shared goals can only be accomplished through close collaboration among stakeholders in the process.In an effort to foster mutual collaboration, members of the pharmaceutical industry and the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals founded a unique collaborative venture in 2008 - the Medical Publishing Insights and Practices initiative (MPIP). At an MPIP roundtable meeting in September 2009,journal editors, publishers and industry representatives identified and prioritized opportunities to streamline the submission process and requirements, and to support prompt publication and dissemination of clinical trial results in the face of increasing manuscript volume. Journal and sponsor participants agreed that more author education on manuscript preparation and submission was needed to increase efficiency and enhance quality and transparency in the publication of industry-sponsored research. They suggested an authors'guide to help bridge the gap between author practices and editor expectations.To address this unmet educational need, MPIP supported development of an Authors' Submission Toolkit to compile best practices in the preparation and submission of manuscripts describing sponsored research.The Toolkit represents a unique collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical journals,and reflects both groups' perspectives on how authors can help raise standards and increase efficiency in publishing industry-sponsored studies. The information provided in the toolkit can be useful to help authors navigate the manuscript},

abstract = {One of the most salient features of emotion is the pronounced variability among individuals in their reactions to emotional incentives and in their dispositional mood. Collectively, these individual differences have been described as affective style. Recent research has begun to dissect the constituents of affective style. The search for these components is guided by the neural systems that instantiate emotion and emotion regulation. In this article, this body of research and theory is applied specifically to positive affect and well-being. The central substrates and peripheral biological correlates of well-being are described. A resilient affective style is associated with high levels of left prefrontal activation, effective modulation of activation in the amygdala and fast recovery in response to negative and stressful events. In peripheral biology, these central patterns are associated with lower levels of basal cortisol and with higher levels of antibody titres to influenza vaccine. The article concludes with a consideration of whether these patterns of central and peripheral biology can be modified by training and shifted toward a more salubrious direction.},

In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes. },

Aus dieser intersubjektiven Sichtweise heraus besteht die Hauptthese darin, dass Scham in erster Linie als ein intersubjektives Geschehen zu konzeptuallisieren ist, nicht als intrasubjektives Geschehen. Dies wird auch durch eine besondere Eigenschaft der Scham, ihre ansteckende Natur deutlich. Was die Verortung der Scham angeht, wird postuliert, dass Scham als Affekt nicht einfach im Selbst eines Menschen wurzelt, d.h. subjektive Bedeutung besitzt. Scham geht auch nicht prim{\"{a}}r nur aus inneren Motiven (v.a. exhibitionistischen Motiven) hervor, sondern muss als ein Relikt einer interpersonalen Situation der Besch{\"{a}}mung und Dem{\"{u}}tigung angesehen werden, als Erleben fehlender intersubjektiver Anerkennung.

The present cross-sectional study of 514 college students (84% Caucasian and 62% females), using self-report questionnaires, tested a proposed model for understanding the relationship between dispositional mindfulness and depressive symptoms through three types of affect regulation: emotion regulation, mood regulation and self-regulation, as measured by positive emotions, mood regulation expectancies (i.e., perceived mood repair ability), and self-acceptance, respectively. Structural equation modeling revealed that the model fit the data well, with the relationship between mindfulness, as measured by the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and depressive symptoms, as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, fully mediated by the proposed regulatory processes. Higher levels of dispositional mindfulness were associated with higher levels of positive emotions, mood regulation expectancies, and self-acceptance, which in turn, were all inversely related to depressive symptoms. Self-acceptance emerged as the strongest mediator of mindfulness and depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that mindfulness might serve a regulatory function by targeting low positive emotionality, poor mood regulation, and negative self-concept, risk factors implicated in the onset, development, and maintenance of depressive symptoms. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {The occurrence of phasic reductions of EMG activity during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep in man and cat are described, and an analysis of the phenomenon in man is presented. Twelve subjects (ten male, two female) slept a total of 107 nights in the sleep laboratory. Standard recordings were taken of electroencephalographic (EEG), electrooculographic (EOG), and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Suppressions of EMG were observed in all subjects during all stages of non-REM sleep, but occurred with the greatest frequency during stages 2 and 4. The suppressions averaged 250 msec in duration and exhibited a higher frequency in the 10 min immediately prior to REM periods than in the 10 min immediately subsequent to REM periods. The relationship between the H reflex and phasic EMG suppressions was examined in three subjects (two males, one female) who were recorded a total of 9 nights. In addition to standard EEG, EOG, and EMG derivations, the H reflex was elicited by electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve, recorded from the soleus muscle, and viewed on an oscilloscope. The EEG, EMG, and soleus muscle action potentials were recorded on magnetic tape. In all subjects it was found that whenever a stimulus occurred coincidental with a phasic EMG reduction, the reflex response was invariably inhibited. The observation and verification of phasic activity during non-REM sleep in the human subject is related to recent data in the cat, and the application of this physiological event to studies of non-REM mentation is discussed.},

abstract = {The experience of the present moment is characterized by an integrative mechanism that fuses successive events into a unitary phenomenological experience with a temporal limit of about 3. s. We hypothesized that proficiency of mindfulness expands the ability to stabilize an ambiguous percept in a bistable image paradigm using the Necker Cube, and that this effect is associated with individual differences in the level of mindfulness. Expanded duration of nowness as indicated by the ability to stabilize a bistable image stimulus for a longer period of time may improve cognitive resources and thus be of practical interest. In a sample of n= 38 meditators and n= 38 non-meditators, meditators showed longer duration of subjective nowness. This effect was associated with individual mindfulness levels. It is concluded that the subjective now can be longer for meditators than for non-meditators, and individual levels of mindfulness may convey this effect. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Stress has been defined in different ways over the years. Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person. The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual. It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation. Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others. Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).View this table:In this windowIn a new window Box 1: The problem of stress Signs of stress can be seen in people&#039;s behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches). If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1).1View this table:In this windowIn a new window Box 2 : Signs of stress Figure 1 A model of stress at work.1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations. Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.

abstract = {This pilot trial evaluated the efficacy of a multifaith spiritually based intervention (SBI) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD of at least moderate severity were randomized to either 12 sessions of the SBI (n=11) delivered by a spiritual care counselor or 12 sessions of psychologist-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; n=11). Outcome measures were completed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Primary efficacy measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat sample using the Last Observation Carried Forward method. Eighteen patients (82%) completed the study. The SBI produced robust and clinically significant reductions from baseline in psychic and somatic symptoms of GAD and was comparable in efficacy to CBT. A reduction in depressive symptoms and improvement in social adjustment was also observed. Treatment response occurred in 63.6% of SBI-treated and 72.3% of CBT-treated patients. Gains were maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. These preliminary findings are encouraging and suggest that a multifaith SBI may be an effective treatment option for GAD. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of this intervention.},

In particular, little research in this field has examined the nature of mindfulness and whether it relates to task performance in organizational and occupational settings. Filling these gaps, the present article delineates mindfulness by (a) defining it as a state of consciousness in which attention is focused on present-moment phenomena occurring both externally and internally, (b) comparing it to a range of other attention-related concepts, and (c) developing theory concerning the factors that determine when mindfulness is beneficial versus costly from a task performance standpoint.},

have important implications for self-report measures of approach
and avoidance behaviours and how Gray's model relates to other personality
models. In this paper, we examine the revised RST by comparing Carver
and White's (1994) original one-factor solution of the BIS scale
with two alternative two-factor solutions separating BIS-Anxiety
and FFFS-Fear. We also examine the relationships between Eysenck's
PEN and revised RST factors. Two hundred and twelve participants
completed Carver and White's BIS/BAS scales and Eysenck's Personality
Questionnaire-Revised. Confirmatory factor analyses of the original
BIS scale showed that the hypothesized two-factor model of BIS-Anxiety
and FFFS-Fear was the best fit to these data. Associations between
the revised RST and Eysenck's PEN were examined using path analysis.
In line with theoretical predictions, Psychoticism was related to
revised BIS-Anxiety and BAS, Neuroticism to revised BIS-Anxiety and
FFFS-Fear, and extraversion to BAS and FFFS-Fear. Distinctions between
BAS subscales and their associations to BIS, N and P were made in
terms of past, present and future focus. Possible explanations for
mixed findings in the literature and implications for future research
are discussed.},

abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

abstract = {This article presents questions, reflections and proposed resolutions
regarding the Judgement Axis of the International Classification
of Nursing Practice, Beta Version (ICNP beta). The Judgement Axis,
in its present format, consists of an alphabetical listing of terms
that are meant to reflect the clinical opinion of a nurse relating
to the state of a nursing phenomenon appearing in Axis A of the ICNP
beta. A review of literature indicates that judgement can be more
extensive. Not considered in the development of the Axis is the fact
that judgement can be clinical and actuarial. Actuarial judgement
is predictive and based on statistics. Clinical judgement is patient-centred,
creative and intuitive. Both are essential in defining nursing judgement.
The list presents 49 modifiers in nominal form. Each of these is
subordinated, in alphanumeric descending order, by qualifiers that
do not conform to the concept of lexical hierarchy. We propose that
the 49 terms which appear in the present listing as unique ordinates
should be clustered into major categories with synonyms listed as
subordinates of the major cluster headings. The qualifiers of degree,
which are presently identified as subordinates in Axis B, might be
presented in matrix format, providing a scale of degree of the modifier
for the nurse.},

abstract = {People generally prefer their initials to the other letters of the alphabet, a phenomenon known as the name-letter effect. This effect, researchers have argued, makes people move to certain cities, buy particular brands of consumer products, and choose particular professions (e.g., Angela moves to Los Angeles, Phil buys a Philips TV, and Dennis becomes a dentist). In order to establish such associations between people's initials and their behavior, researchers typically carry out statistical analyses of large databases. Current methods of analysis ignore the hierarchical structure of the data, do not naturally handle order-restrictions, and are fundamentally incapable of confirming the null hypothesis. Here we outline a Bayesian hierarchical analysis that avoids these limitations and allows coherent inference both on the level of the individual and on the level of the group. To illustrate our method, we re-analyze two data sets that address the question of whether people are disproportionately likely to live in cities that resemble their name.},

The impact of this research has started to change course content and structure, in both introductory and advanced courses for statisticians and those from other disciplines. In the light of these changes future directions in the teaching and learning of statistics must take into account new innovative pedagogical instructions, educational technologies and the abundance of Web resources that are now available. This article examines different aspects of currently identified challenges in the teaching and learning of statistics and gives an overview of useful strategies and innovations for developing research-based statistics courses in the context of recommendations for reforms, outlining the place of information technology within this framework. The article presents a review of the literature on the topic of statistics education and gives instructors a set of guidelines for generating new and effective teaching material. The summarised recommendations incorporate many innovations employed in a variety of successful statistics classes today. The review is complemented by a collection of statistics related online resources currently available on the Web.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Based on Donabedian's structure, process, and outcome model, this study was conducted to identify the underlying dimensions of patient satisfaction for diabetic patients and determine the effects of demographic characteristics and health status on these dimensions.\n\nDESIGN: A cross-sectional analytical research design was used with a questionnaire, comprising demographic characteristics, the general and mental health items from the SF-20, and a 25-item patient satisfaction scale.\n\nSETTING AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was administered to 263 South African black diabetic outpatients from the diabetic clinics at two hospitals. There were 174 females and 89 males, aged between 16 and 89 years (mean = 53.5, sd = 13.9). The average number of years of schooling was 6.3 (sd = 4.1). Main outcome measure. A reliable and valid patient satisfaction scale.\n\nRESULTS: Factor analysis was conducted on the patient satisfaction scale and two factors, accounting for 71.6% of the variance, were extracted. The major items on Factor I were support, consideration, friendliness, and encouragement, labelled the interpersonal dimension. Factor II emphasized availability of a seat and toilet in the waiting area and cleanliness, labelled the organizational dimension. The two factors had very good reliability coefficients: 0.85 (organizational) and 0.98 (interpersonal). Multi-trait scaling showed that all items exceeded the item convergent (r > 0.40) and discriminant (Z > 1.96) validity criteria. Patients in poor general health were significantly less satisfied (P = 0.007) with the organizational quality of their care than patients in good health; patients in poor mental health were significantly less satisfied (P = 0.04) with the interpersonal quality of their care than patients in good mental health.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings provided support for Donabedian's model. They demonstrated that attributes of providers and settings are major components of patient satisfaction, and showed that the scale is a reliable and valid measure of patient satisfaction for this South African population.},

Conjoint measurement is a worthwhile alternative to significance testing. Conjoint measurement determines whether data obey the ordinal properties of a model that contains main effect terms, interaction terms, or a combination of the two. Unlike hypothesis testing, with conjoint measurement an increase in statistical power leads to a greater risk of refuting a theory. In this study, conjoint measurement was used to describe how systems-oriented therapists predict the occurrence of suicide. Although the systems approach emphasizes the interaction between an individual and a system, all 10 clinicians were described by an additive model.},

used to measure spirituality reflect this trend. These measures are
heavily contaminated with questions assessing positive character
traits or mental health: optimism, forgiveness, gratitude, meaning
and purpose in life, peacefulness, harmony, and general well-being.
Spirituality, measured by indicators of good mental health, is found
to be correlated with good mental health. This research has been
reported in some of the world's top medical journals. Such associations
are meaningless and tautological. Either spirituality should be defined
and measured in traditional terms as a unique, uncontaminated construct,
or it should be eliminated from use in academic research. (C) 2008

abstract = {Objectives This study examines the relationships between mindfulness,
flow dispositions and mental skills adoption.Design Cluster analytic
approach.Methods Participants in this study were 182 university student
athletes. They were administered the Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale
[MMS; Bodner, T., & Langer, E. (2001). Individual differences in
mindfulness: The Langer Mindfulness Scale. Poster session presented
at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Society, Toronto,
Ont., Canada], Dispositional Flow Scale 2 [DFS-2; Jackson, S. A.,
& Eklund, R. C. (2004). The flow scale manual. Morgantown, WV: Fitness
Information Technology] and Test of Performance Strategies [TOPS;
Thomas, P. R., Murphy, S. M., & Hardy, L. (1999). Test of performance
strategies: Development and preliminary validation of a comprehensive
measure of athletes' psychological skills. Journal of Sports Sciences,
17, 697-711].Results Four distinctive mindfulness clusters were found
based on their response on the MMS using cluster analysis. Marked
differences in flow dispositions and mental skills adoption habits
were observed between the high and the low mindfulness clusters.
Those in the high mindfulness cluster scored significantly higher
than the low mindfulness clusters in challenge-skill balance, merging
of action and awareness, clear goals, concentration and loss of self-consciousness
scores of the DFS-2 [Jackson, S.A., & Eklund, R.C. (2004). The flow
scale manual. Morgantown, WV: Fitness Information Technology]. The
high mindfulness clusters also scored significantly higher compared
to the low mindfulness cluster in terms of attentional control, emotional
control, goal setting and self-talk sub-scales of the TOPS.Conclusions
This study suggests that athletes' flow dispositions and mental skills
adoption could be differentiated using mindfulness. The findings
have implications towards the understanding of flow and mental skills
adoption within sport psychology.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

In this report we use Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the critical sample size from which on the magnitude of a correlation can be expected to be stable. The necessary sample size to achieve stable estimates for correlations depends on the effect size, the width of the corridor of stability (i.e., a corridor around the true value where deviations are tolerated), and the requested confidence that the trajectory does not leave this corridor any more. Results indicate that in typical scenarios the sample size should approach 250 for stable estimates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the last few years, there has been a trend in the social and economic sciences to pay closer attention to individual preferences and values in establishing the microanalytical foundations for a theory of human action. Following a series of socio-psychological expansions of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey in recent years, the questionnaire was rounded out further in the year 2005 to include personality indicators. This recent addition was based on the “Big Five” approach, a psychological concept used to describe and study personality. Fundamental to this approach is the assumption that personality differences between indi- viduals, which are manifested in different ways of behaving and experiencing the world, can be traced back to five basic personality traits: Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness to experience (O), Agreeableness (A) and Conscientiousness (C). A pretest was conducted in 2004 on a number of different short item scales to test the Big Five approach, with the goal of developing a useful and widely applicable short item scale (BFI-S) for the 2005 SOEP survey. The short inventory of questions developed in the present study, BFI-S, contains 15 items and can be completed within two minutes. The items in the individual scales display strong inter- nal coherence, and was conceptualized based on the five-factor structure of the Big Five. Additionally, BFI-S is also able to replicate the results of the 25-item BFI to a large extent. The reliability test that was conducted also produced a satisfactory overall result, and showed strong empirical indications for the validity of the personality concept of the Big Five em- ployed in BFI-S.},

abstract = {<p>Background<br/>Both the depression modules of the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS-D) and the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-9) are widely used for the screening of depression. We analyzed
the dimensionality and the item fit of both scales individually and
across the scales. Moreover, we sought to identify items which evidenced
item response bias associated with age and gender.Methods<br/>The
depression subscales HADS-D and the PHQ-9 were administered to 1271
patients (mean age 67.2; 22.5% women) undergoing coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (CABG). Rasch analyses were performed to assess
the overall fit of the model, individual item fit and differential
item functioning (DIF).Results<br/>Rasch analysis revealed that the
HADS-D and the PHQ-9 feature a common core construct containing six
items of the HADS-D and three items of the PHQ-9. Two of these items
are identical with the 2-item short form of the PHQ-9. In addition,
fatigability was the only somatic item that fitted the model. No
substantial DIF was observed.Limitations<br/>The generalizability
of these results might be restricted to patients awaiting CABG.Conclusions<br/>The
short form of the PHQ-9 seems to be an economic and valid instrument
for the screening of depression, which indicates the same latent
construct that is captured by six items of the HADS-D. Further studies
are needed to evaluate whether the addition of fatigability might
enhance the validity of the PHQ-2 in this patient population.</p>},

abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) is perhaps the most innovative instructional method conceived in the his- tory of education. PBL was originally designed to respond to the criticism that traditional teaching and learning methods fail to prepare medical students for solving problems in clinical settings. Instead of requir- ing that students study content knowledge and then practice context-free problems, PBL embeds students' learning processes in real-life problems. After its suc- cessful implementation in various fields of medical education, PBL is now being implemented throughout higher education as well as in K–12 education. The purpose of this chapter is to inform researchers and practitioners about research findings and issues in PBL that may be used to inform future studies. In this chap- ter, we review PBL research from the past 30 years. We first describe the history of development and imple- mentation of PBL in various educational settings and define the major characteristics of PBL. We then review the research on PBL. First, we examine the effective- ness of PBL in terms of student learning outcomes, including basic domain knowledge acquisition and applications, retention of content and problem-solving skills, higher order thinking, self-directed learning/life- long learning, and self-perception. Second, we look at implementation issues, such as tutoring issues, curric- ulum design issues, and use of technology. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research.},

Generalizations to other cases, such as multivariate and nonlinear analysis, are also discussed. It can easily be shown that every popular linear analysis can be derived from understanding MCRA},

abstract = {We examine the controversial practice of using parcels of items as manifest variables in structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures. After detailing arguments pro and con, we conclude that the unconsidered use of parcels is never warranted, while, at the same time, the considered use of parcels cannot be dismissed out of hand. In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one's philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in SEM procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses. Using parcels as indicators of constructs in structural equation models (SEMs) has been and remains a controversial practice. Historically, debates on the utility and efficacy of parcels date back over 40 years (e.g., Cattell, 1956; Cattell & Burdsal, 1975), and the debates have continued in contemporary SEM circles (e.g.,},

fear and anxiety are not interchangeable constructs. The second study
examined associations between scores on questionnaire measures of
fear/anxiety and performance in a military training setting; regression
analysis revealed that fear captured significant variance in performance

abstract = {Long-term Vipassana meditators sat in meditation vs. a control rest (mind-wandering) state for 21 min in a counterbalanced design with spontaneous EEG recorded. Meditation state dynamics were measured with spectral decomposition of the last 6 min of the eyes-closed silent meditation compared to control state. Meditation was associated with a decrease in frontal delta (1-4 Hz) power, especially pronounced in those participants not reporting drowsiness during meditation. Relative increase in frontal theta (4-8 Hz) power was observed during meditation, as well as significantly increased parieto-occipital gamma (35-45 Hz) power, but no other state effects were found for the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), or beta (12-25 Hz) bands. Alpha power was sensitive to condition order, and more experienced meditators exhibited no tendency toward enhanced alpha during meditation relative to the control task. All participants tended to exhibit decreased alpha in association with reported drowsiness. Cross-experimental session occipital gamma power was the greatest in meditators with a daily practice of 10+ years, and the meditation-related gamma power increase was similarly the strongest in such advanced practitioners. The findings suggest that long-term Vipassana meditation contributes to increased occipital gamma power related to long-term meditational expertise and enhanced sensory awareness.},

abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated some accuracy in personality attribution using only visual appearance. Using composite images of those scoring high and low on a particular trait, the current study shows that judges perform better than chance in guessing others' personality, particularly for the traits conscientiousness and extraversion. This study also shows that attractiveness, masculinity and age may all provide cues to assess personality accurately and that accuracy is affected by the sex of both of those judging and being judged. Individuals do perform better than chance at guessing another's personality from only facial information, providing some support for the popular belief that it is possible to assess accurately personality from faces.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a short, 4-item arthritis severity questionnaire
that is simple to score, clinically useful and meaningful, and suitable
for use in primary care, where osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary
prevalent arthritis illness. METHODS: Data and items from the Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36), the Western Ontario McMaster
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC(c)), and visual analog scales (VAS) for
pain and patient global severity were studied in 16,519 patients
with arthritis. The Short Arthritis Assessment Scale (SAS) was developed
by performing multivariable analyses that involved individually adding/subtracting
items in differing regression models. The candidate items and scales
were then studied by Rasch analysis, and tested for effect size,
sensitivity to change, and reliability. The resultant scale was validated
using data from a recent OA clinical trial. RESULTS: The VAS pain
and VAS global severity scales and 2 items from the WOMAC in the
VAS format, difficulty going down stairs and difficulty shopping,
were found to be the best predictors of change in health status.
The 4-item SAS was reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87), demonstrated
good test-retest reliability (Lin's concordance coefficient = 0.85),
was unidimensional, and was strongly correlated with other important
clinical measures, indicating good construct validity. Using data
from a recent randomized clinical trial in OA, the SAS performed
better than the WOMAC pain scale and the SF-36 physical component
score in detecting change, and at least as well as the clinical trial
VAS pain scale. CONCLUSION: The SAS is a 4-item arthritis severity
questionnaire that can be easily administered in primary care for
patients with OA, but is suitable for use across all arthritis illnesses.
Scoring is simple, requiring only the addition of four 10-point scales,
and interpretation is straightforward. The SAS may have a role in
rapid assessment of the arthritis patient in primary care practice.},

The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature. Electronic copies of these macros may be downloaded from the Psychonomic Society's Web archive at www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},

The noninvasive analysis of physiological signals (NAPS) system is a BCG-based monitoring system developed to measure heart rate, breathing rate, and musculoskeletal movement that shows promise as a general sleep analysis tool. Overnight sleep studies were conducted on 40 healthy subjects during a clinical trial at the University of Virginia. The NAPS system's measures of heart rate and breathing rate were compared to ECG, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). The subjects were split into a training dataset and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each set. The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of RIP bands used in polysomnography.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American
College of Rheumatology Disease Damage Index (SLICC/ACR-DI) item
weightings that improve the ability of the measure to predict patient
mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Disease
damage was measured for 738 patients followed at the University of
Toronto Lupus Clinic since diagnosis. Using Rasch analysis, item
weightings were determined and tested for their ability to predict
death in a logistic regression model. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves were produced to compare the original and weighted scales'
ability to discriminate patients that died during the followup period
from those who remained alive. RESULTS: The average SLICC/ACR-DI
score per patient was 1.66. In total, 138 of the patients died during
a mean followup of 9.2 years. A Rasch analysis derived weighting
scheme using weighted domain scores (SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted) was the
best weighted scale, with item reliability = 94%, model mean square
infit = 1.01 (STD = 0.05); model mean square outfit = 0.99 (STD =
0.3), separation 4.08. The SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was modestly better
than the SLICC/ACR-DI in discriminating patients who died from those
who remained alive. Using standardized scores for comparability,
the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was better in predicting patient death
than the unweighted SLICC/ACR-DI [OR(death)(SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted)
= 1.7 vs OR(death)(SLICC-ACR-DI) = 1.4; p < 0.005]. ROC curve analysis
supports that the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was somewhat superior to
the SLICC/ACR-DI for predicting mortality. CONCLUSION: In this test
set, the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was modestly better in predicting
death than the traditional unweighted SLICC/ACR-DI. However, the
SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted is more difficult to apply and the weightings
appear not to have provided a clinically relevant improvement of
the SLICC-ACR-DI.},

abstract = {Although patients' satisfaction with treatment has gained much attention, conceptual and methodological issues are not sufficiently investigated. Consequently, well-validated satisfaction scales are rare. In order to respond to methodological requirements being associated with the measurement of patient satisfaction, the Munich Patient Satisfaction Scale (MPSS-24) was developed for psychiatric in-patients. The scale was validated on the basis of three independent samples (n=85, n= 161, n=91), and the effects of moderating variables were controlled. In several steps of item selection the initial pool of 133 items was reduced to 24 items, which were subjected to factor analysis. The MPSS-24 demonstrates one major principal component with two minor factors which indicates that doctor-patient communication is the essential source for patient satisfaction. The instrument is of high internal consistency and reliability, and convergent validity is satisfactory.},

of the International Classification for Nursing Practice-based (ICNP)
nursing data dictionary (NDD) through its application in an enterprise
electronic medical record (EMR) system as a standard vocabulary at
a single tertiary hospital in Korea. Data from 2,262 inpatients obtained
over a period of 9 weeks (May to July 2003) were extracted from the
EMR system for analysis. Among the 530,218 data-input events, 401,190
(75.7%) were entered from the NDD, 20,550 (3.9%) used only free text,
and 108,478 (20.4%) used a combination of coded data and free text.
A content analysis of the free-text events showed that 80.3% of the
expressions could be found in the NDD, whereas 10.9% were context-specific
expressions such as direct quotations of patient complaints and responses,
and references to the care plan or orders of physicians. A total
of 7.8% of the expressions was used for a supplementary purpose such
as adding a conjunction or end verb to make an expression appear
as natural language. Only 1.0% of the expressions were identified
as not being covered by the NDD. This evaluation study demonstrates
that the ICNP-based NDD has sufficient power to cover most of the
expressions used in a clinical nursing setting.},

abstract = {The 15 items of the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003 ) are negatively worded and assumed to assess mindfulness. However, there are indications of differences between the original MAAS and a version with the positively rephrased MAAS items (“mirror items”). The present study examines whether the mindfulness facet “mindful attention and awareness” (MAA) can be measured with both positively and negatively worded items if we take method effects due to item wording into account. To this end, the 15 negatively worded items of the MAAS and additionally 13 positively rephrased items were assessed ( N = 602). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) models with and without regard to method effects were carried out and evaluated by means of model fit. As a result, the positively and negatively worded items should be seen as different methods that influence the construct validity of mindfulness. Furthermore, a modified version of the MAAS (MAAS-Short) with five negatively worded items (taken from the MAAS) and five positively worded items (“mirror items”) was introduced as an alternative to assess MAA. The MAAS-Short appears superior to the original MAAS. The results and the limitations of the present study are discussed.},

In the ten years since publication of the first edition of this bestselling text, great strides have been made in the development of new methods and in software for generalized linear models and other closely related models.Thoroughly revised and updated, An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition continues to initiate intermediate students of statistics, and the many other disciplines that use statistics, in the practical use of these models and methods. The new edition incorporates many of the important developments of the last decade, including survival analysis, nominal and ordinal logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, and multi-level models. It also includes modern methods for checking model adequacy and examples from an even wider range of application. Statistics can appear to the uninitiated as a collection of unrelated tools. An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition illustrates how these apparently disparate methods are examples or special cases of a conceptually simple structure based on the exponential family of distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, and the principles of statistical modelling.},

abstract = {Our recent work showed that self-trait judgment is associated with increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in non-religious Chinese, but in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in Chinese Christians. The current work further investigated neural substrates of self-referential processing in Chinese Buddhists. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 14 Chinese Buddhists, while they conducted trait judgments of the self, Zhu Rongji (the former Chinese premier), Sakyamuni (the Buddhist leader) and Jesus (the Christian leader). We found that, relative to Zhu Rongji judgment, self-judgment in Buddhist participants failed to generate increased activation in the VMPFC but induced increased activations in the DMPFC/rostral anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate and the left frontal/insular cortex. Self-judgment was also associated with decreased functional connectivity between the DMPFC and posterior parietal cortex compared with Zhu Rongji judgment. The results suggest that Buddhist doctrine of No-self results in weakened neural coding of stimulus self-relatedness in the VMPFC, but enhanced evaluative processes of self-referential stimuli in the DMPFC. Moreover, self-referential processing in Buddhists is characterized by monitoring the conflict between the doctrine of No-self and self-focus thinking during self-trait judgment.},

Factor analysis is faulted for mistaking ordinally labeled stochastic observations for linear measures and for failing to construct linear measurement. The motivation and mathematical basis for Rasch measurement are introduced. How to use Rasch measurement to replace factor analysis is developed for a dichotomy and demonstrated for a rating scale.

abstract = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

Selected data from a recent study by Craig et al. were analyzed using Observation Oriented Modeling; this analysis was contrasted with a traditional repeated measures ANOVA assessment. Various pitfalls in traditional parametric analyses were avoided when using Observation Oriented Modeling, including the presence of outliers and missing data.

abstract = {AIM This paper presents a discussion of the conceptual and practical
relationships between the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health and the NANDA-International Taxonomy II for
nursing diagnoses, and their use in nursing practice. BACKGROUND
The ICF provides a common classification framework for all healthcare
professionals, including nurses. Nursing care plans can be broadly
based on NANDA-I taxonomies. No published attempt has been made to
systematically compare the NANDA-I Taxonomy II to the ICF. DATA SOURCES
The most recently published descriptions of both classifications
and a case example presenting the combined use of both classifications.
The work was carried out in 2009. DISCUSSION There are conceptual
commonalities and differences between the ICF and the NANDA-I Taxonomy
II. In the case example, the overlap between the ICF categories and
NANDA-I nursing diagnoses reflects the fact that the ICF, focusing
on functioning and disability, and the NANDA-I Taxonomy II, with
its functioning health patterns, are similar in their approaches.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING The NANDA-I Taxonomy II permits the fulfilment
of requirements that are exclusively nursing issues. The application
of the ICF is useful for nurses to communicate nursing issues with
other healthcare professionals in a common language. For nurses,
knowledge shared with other healthcare professionals may contribute
to broader understanding of a patient's situation. CONCLUSION The
ICF and the NANDA-I Taxonomy II should be used in concert by nurses
and can complement each other to enhance the quality of clinical
team work and nursing practice.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Development of an adaptive, International Classification
of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)-oriented patient questionnaire
on mobility and self-care based on an item response theory model
(MOSES questionnaire). METHODS Using item reconstruction rules, items
were developed for the ICF chapters "mobility", "self-care" and "domestic
life". The resulting instrument, together with other instruments
(SF-36, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire (SMFA),
MacNew, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Barthel) was presented
to 549 patients with musculoskeletal disease, 212 patients with cardiac
disease and 258 neurological rehabilitation patients in rehabilitation
clinics in Germany. RESULTS The MOSES questionnaire includes 58 items
on 12 scales and fulfills the requirements of the 1-parameter item
response theory model (Rasch model). The results indicate good reliability
and high construct validity and sensitivity to change of the instrument.
In the construction and selection of items, ICF contents that include
complex processes of evaluation, and which presuppose skills that
are not acquired prior to the individual learning process, were omitted
due to a lack of unidimensionality. CONCLUSION The successful implementation
of the concept of applying rules to ICF categories in formulating
the items of a patient questionnaire showed that the goal of a theory-driven
measurement of activities using the ICF is feasible. The results
of the project also raise questions as to the homogeneity of the
contents of some ICF categories.},

abstract = {Purpose. To propose the joint use of the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) and the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) and to illustrate this proposal using
musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Method. In light of the MSK conditions
as classified in the ICD, categories from existing ICF core sets
for MSK conditions were pooled to specify functioning. Another approach
was to consider other categories from measures or instruments already
linked in the literature. Results. ICF Categories have been pooled
from six core sets for MSK conditions, two specific care settings,
one MSK clinical trial setting and eight instrument linkage papers.
Conclusions. The ICD–ICF joint use would be able to capture the
impact of a health condition by taking into account the disease and
functioning status which would facilitate clinical care. Therefore,
there is reasonable ground to demonstrate the operational linkage
and complementary role of the ICD and the ICF in the context of the
ICD revision.},

In a block-design fMRI study, we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings. A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between-subject random effects analysis. Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in premotor cortex, in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula. We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred, the right insula, right premotor cortex and the right fronto-medial gyrus. One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus. The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love, this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter, namely the putamen and the insula.},

abstract = {According to R.A. Fisher, randomization “relieves the experimenter from the anxiety of considering innumerable causes by which the data may be disturbed.” Since, in particular, it is said to control for known and unknown nuisance factors that may considerably challenge the validity of a result, it has become very popular. This contribution challenges the received view. First, looking for quantitative support, we study a number of straightforward, mathematically simple models. They all demonstrate that the optimism surrounding randomization is questionable: In small to medium-sized samples, random allocation of units to treatments typically yields a considerable imbalance between the groups, i.e., confounding due to randomization is the rule rather than the exception. In the second part of this contribution, the reasoning is extended to a number of traditional arguments in favour of randomization. This discussion is rather non-technical, and sometimes touches on the rather fundamental Frequentist/Bayesian debate. However, the result of this analysis turns out to be quite similar: While the contribution of randomization remains doubtful, comparability contributes much to a compelling conclusion. Summing up, classical experimentation based on sound background theory and the systematic construction of exchangeable groups seems to be advisable.},

abstract = {Although the relationship between strength and physical performance
in older adults is probably non-linear, few empirical studies have
demonstrated that this is so. In a population-based sample of adults
aged 60-96 years (n = 409), leg strength was measured in four muscle
groups (knee extensor, knee flexor, ankle plantar flexor, ankle dorsiflexor)
of both legs using an isokinetic dynamometer. A leg strength score
was calculated as the sum of the four strength measurements in the
right leg. Usual gait speed was measured over a 15.2 metre course.
With a linear model, leg strength explained 17% of the variance in
gait speed. Non-linear models (quadratic and inverse) explained significantly
more variance (22%). The nature of the non-linear relationship was
that, in stronger subjects, there was no association between strength
and gait speed, while in weaker subjects, there was an association.
Body weight and age also explained significant amounts of variance
in gait speed, while sex and height did not. The results supported
the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between leg strength
and gait speed that is similar for older men and women. This finding
represents a mechanism for how small changes in physiological capacity
may have substantial effects on performance in frail adults, while
large changes in capacity have little or no effect in healthy adults.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been notable interest in additive models of sensory integration. Binaural additivity has emerged as a main hypothesis in the loudness-scaling literature and has recently been asserted by authors using an axiomatic approach to psychophysics. Restrictions of the range of stimuli used in the majority of former experiments, and inherent weaknesses of the axiomatic study by Levelt, Riemersma, and Bunt (1972) are discussed as providing reasons for the present investigation. A limited binaural additivity (LBA) model is proposed that assumes contralateral binaural inhibition for interaural intensity differences that exceed a critical level. Experimental data are reported for 12 subjects in a loudness-matching task designed to test the axioms of cancellation and of commutativity, both necessary to the existence of strict binaural additivity. In a 2 X 2 design, frequencies of 200 Hz and 2 kHz were used, and mean intensity levels were 20 dB apart. Additivity was found violated in 33 out of 48 possible tests. The LBA model is shown to predict the systematic nonadditivity in the loudness judgments and to conform to results from other studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: No published quantitative instrument exists to measure maternal satisfaction with the quality of different models of labour care in the UK. METHODS: A quantitative psychometric multidimensional maternal satisfaction questionnaire, the Women's Views of Birth Labour Satisfaction Questionnaire (WOMBLSQ), was developed using principal components analysis with varimax rotation of successive versions. Internal reliability and content and construct validity were assessed. RESULTS: Of 300 women sent the first version (WOMBLSQ1), 120 (40%) replied; of 300 sent WOMBLSQ2, 188 (62.7%) replied; of 500 women sent WOMBLSQ3, 319 (63.8%) replied; and of 2400 women sent WOMBLSQ4, 1683 (70.1%) replied. The latter two versions consisted of 10 dimensions in addition to general satisfaction. These were (Cronbach's alpha): professional support in labour (0.91), expectations of labour (0.90), home assessment in early labour (0.90), holding the baby (0.87), support from husband/partner (0.83), pain relief in labour (0.83), pain relief immediately after labour (0.65), knowing labour carers (0.82), labour environment (0.80), and control in labour (0.62). There were moderate correlations (range 0.16-0.73) between individual dimensions and the general satisfaction scale (0.75). Scores on individual dimensions were significantly related to a range of clinical and demographic variables. CONCLUSION: This multidimensional labour satisfaction instrument has good validity and internal reliability. It could be used to assess care in labour across different models of maternity care, or as a prelude to in depth exploration of specific areas of concern. Its external reliability and transferability to care outside the South West region needs further evaluation, particularly in terms of ethnicity and social class.},

In addition, our findings suggest that only minimal additions or

to support the formal definition of nursing actions such as those

abstract = {A reliable and precise classification of tumors is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer. cDNA microarrays and high-density oligonucleotide chips are novel biotechnologies increasingly used in cancer research. By allowing the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously, microarray experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among tumors and hence to a finer and more informative classification. The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification. This article compares the performance of different discrimination methods for the classification of tumors based on gene expression data. The methods include nearest-neighbor classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees. Recent machine learning approaches, such as bagging and boosting, are also considere...},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {1. Recent technical and methodological advances have led to a dramatic increase in the use of spectrometry to quantify reflectance properties of biological materials, as well asmodels to determine how these colours are per- ceived by animals, providing important insights into ecological and evolutionary aspects of animal visual com- munication. 2. Despite this growing interest, a unified cross-platform framework for analysing and visualizing spectral data has not been available. We introduce pavo, an R package that facilitates the organization, visualization and analysis of spectral data in a cohesive framework. pavo is highly flexible, allowing users to (a) organize and manipulate data from a variety of sources, (b) visualize data using R's state-of-the-art graphics capabilities and (c) analyse data using spectral curve shape properties and visual systemmodelling for a broad range of taxa. 3. In this paper, we present a summary of the functions implemented in pavo and how they integrate in a work- flow to explore and analyse spectral data.We also present an exact solution for the calculation of colour volume overlap in colourspace, thus expanding previously publishedmethodologies. 4. As an example of pavo's capabilities, we compare the colour patterns of three African glossy starling species, two of which have diverged very recently. We demonstrate how both colour vision models and direct spectral measurement analysis can be used to describe colour attributes and differences between these species. Different approaches to visual models and several plotting capabilities exemplify the package's versatility and streamlined workflow. 5. pavo provides a cohesive environment for handling spectral data and addressing complex sensory ecology questions, while integratingwithR's modular core for a broader and comprehensive analytical framework, automated management of spectral data and reproducibleworkflows for colour analysis.},

abstract = {In this research we investigated the role of mindfulness-based attention in mitigating possible negative consequences of experiencing depressive affect. A sample of 278 undergraduate college students completed self-report measures of depressive affect, negative cognitions, and mindfulness-based attention. As expected, depressive affect was positively related to negative cognitions, mindfulness-based attention was inversely related to negative cognitions, and the strength of the relationship between depressed affect and negative cognitions was significantly moderated by mindfulness-based attention. More specifically, a simple slope analysis revealed that individuals low in mindfulness-based attention evidenced a statistically significant relationship between depressive affect and negative cognitions, whereas individuals who are high in mindfulness-based attention did not. These findings support the extant literature suggesting that the general tendency to be mindful may be a protective factor against the development of psychopathology and enhance mental health. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

component of general health status are often based on sets of hierarchically-structured
items intended to represent a broad underlying concept. Rasch Item
Response Theory (IRT) provides a methodology to examine the hierarchical

Study patients (N = 3445) were used to examine the hierarchical order,

of the PF-10 for most patients, and established the reproducibility
of item calibrations across patient populations and repeated tests.
These findings support the content validity of the PF-10 as a measure
of physical functioning and suggest that valid Rasch-IRT summary

abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous research has shown a correlation between physician job satisfaction and patient satisfaction with quality of care, but the connection between job satisfaction of other primary care team members and patient satisfaction is yet unclear. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether there is an association between patient satisfaction and job satisfaction of the members of patient care teams. DESIGN The study was based on data from the European Practice Assessment and used an observational design. SETTING 676 primary care practices in Germany. PARTICIPANTS 47 168 patients, 676 general practitioners (practice principals), 305 physician colleagues (trainees and permanently employed physicians) and 3011 non-physician practice members (nurses, secretaries). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient evaluation was measured using the 23-item EUROPEP questionnaire. Job satisfaction was measured using the 10-item Warr-Cook-Wall job satisfaction scale and further items relating to practice structure. Bivariate correlations were applied in which factors of patient satisfaction and practice structure were compared with physicians and non-physicians satisfaction. RESULTS Patient satisfaction correlates positively with the general job satisfaction of the non-physician (r=0.25, p<0.01) and no significant correlation was found for the general job satisfaction of practice principals and physician colleagues. Patients' satisfaction with the practice organisation correlates positively with the general job satisfaction of the non-physicians (r=0.30, p<0.01) and their view of practice structure (r=0.29, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The correlation between non-physician team member satisfaction and patient satisfaction was higher than the correlation between satisfaction of physicians and patients. Patients seem to be sensitive to aspects of practice structure.},

We report on aversive learning studies in drone and worker honey bees (Apis mellifera anatolica) in escape, punishment and discriminative punishment situations. In all three experiments, a newly developed electric shock avoidance assay was used. The comparisons of expected and observed responses were performed with conventional statistical methods and a systematic randomization modeling approach called object oriented modeling. The escape experiment consisted of two measurements recorded in a master–yoked paradigm: frequency of response and latency to respond following administration of shock. Master individuals could terminate an unavoidable shock triggered by a decrementing 30 s timer by crossing the shuttlebox centerline following shock activation. Across all groups, there was large individual response variation. When assessing group response frequency and latency, master subjects performed better than yoked subjects for both workers and drones. In the punishment experiment, individuals were shocked upon entering the shock portion of a bilaterally wired shuttlebox. The shock portion was spatially static and unsignalled. Only workers effectively avoided the shock. The discriminative punishment experiment repeated the punishment experiment but included a counterbalanced blue and yellow background signal and the side of shock was manipulated. Drones correctly responded less than workers when shock was paired with blue. However, when shock was paired with yellow there was no observable difference between drones and workers.},

risks for physicians, e. g., burnout, depression, marital disturbances,
alcohol and substance abuse, and suicide. The purpose of this study
was to identify psychosocial health resources and risk factors in
profession-related behaviour and experience patterns of medical students
and physicians that may serve as a basis for appropriate health promoting
interventions.METHODS:The questionnaire -Related Behaviour and Experience
"Work administered in cross-sectional surveys to students in the
first (n = 475) and in the fifth year of studies (n = 355) in required
courses at three German universities and to physicians in early professional
life in the vicinity of these universities (n = 381).RESULTS:Scores
reflecting a healthy behaviour pattern were less likely in physicians
(16.7%) compared to 5th year (26.0%) and 1st year students (35.1%)
while scores representing unambitious and resigned patterns were
more common among physicians (43.4% vs. 24.4% vs. 41.0% and 27.3%
vs. 17.2% vs. 23.3 respectively). Female and male responders differed
in the domains professional commitment, resistance to stress and
emotional well-being. Female physicians on average scored higher
in the dimensions resignation tendencies, satisfaction with life
and experience of social support, and lower in career ambition.CONCLUSION:The
results show distinct psychosocial stress patterns among medical
students and physicians. Health promotion and prevention of psychosocial
symptoms and impairments should be integrated as a required part
of the medical curriculum and be considered an important issue during
the further training of physicians.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy--General questionnaire (FACT-G) has been validated few studies have explored the factor structure of the instrument, in particular using non-sample dependent measurement techniques, such as Rasch Models. Furthermore, few studies have explored the relationship between item fit to the Rasch Model and clinical utility. The aim of this study was to investigate the dimensionality and measurement properties of the FACT-G with Rasch Models and Factor analysis. METHODS: A factor analysis and Rasch analysis (Partial Credit Model) was carried out on the FACT-G completed by a heterogeneous sample of cancer patients (n = 465). For the Rasch analysis item fit (infit mean squares > or = 1.30), dimensionality and item invariance were assessed. The impact of removing misfitting items on the clinical utility of the subscales and FACT-G total scale was also assessed. RESULTS: The factor analysis demonstrated a four factor structure of the FACT-G which broadly corresponded to the four subscales of the instrument. Internal consistency for these four scales was very good (Cronbach's alpha 0.72 - 0.85). The Rasch analysis demonstrated that each of the subscales and the FACT-G total scale had misfitting items (infit means square > or = 1.30). All these scales with the exception of the Social & Family Well-being Scale (SFWB) were unidimensional. When misfitting items were removed, the effect sizes and the clinical utility of the instrument were maintained for the subscales and the total FACT-G scores. CONCLUSION: The results of the traditional factor analysis and Rasch analysis of the FACT-G broadly agreed. Caution should be exercised when utilising the Social & Family Well-being scale and further work is required to determine whether this scale is best represented by two factors. Additionally, removing misfitting items from scales should be performed alongside an assessment of the impact on clinical utility.},

abstract = {Context  The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) was developed as a screening instrument but its administration time has limited its clinical usefulness.Objective  To determine if the self-administered PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) has validity and utility for diagnosing mental disorders in primary care comparable to the original clinician-administered PRIME-MD.Design  Criterion standard study undertaken between May 1997 and November 1998.Setting  Eight primary care clinics in the United States.Participants  Of a total of 3000 adult patients (selected by site-specific methods to avoid sampling bias) assessed by 62 primary care physicians (21 general internal medicine, 41 family practice), 585 patients had an interview with a mental health professional within 48 hours of completing the PHQ.Main Outcome Measures  Patient Health Questionnaire diagnoses compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; health care use; and treatment/referral decisions.Results  A total of 825 (28%) of the 3000 individuals and 170 (29%) of the 585 had a PHQ diagnosis. There was good agreement between PHQ diagnoses and those of independent mental health professionals (for the diagnosis of any 1 or more PHQ disorder, $\kappa$ = 0.65; overall accuracy, 85%; sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 90%), similar to the original PRIME-MD. Patients with PHQ diagnoses had more functional impairment, disability days, and health care use than did patients without PHQ diagnoses (for all group main effects, P<.001). The average time required of the physician to review the PHQ was far less than to administer the original PRIME-MD (<3 minutes for 85% vs 16% of the cases). Although 80% of the physicians reported that routine use of the PHQ would be useful, new management actions were initiated or planned for only 117 (32%) of the 363 patients with 1 or more PHQ diagnoses not previously recognized.Conclusion  Our study suggests that the PHQ has diagnostic validity comparable to the original clinician-administered PRIME-MD, and is more efficient to use.},

@article{Garcia2011,
abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to assess whether seventh-grade students use of information and communication technology (ICT) was related to performance on working memory tasks. In addition, the study tested whether the relationship between ICT use and performance on working memory tasks interacted with seventh-grade students' socioeconomic level and gender. 275 students recruited from 30 Chilean schools were grouped according to their self-reported use of PC, the Internet, Chat and Video games. To assess students' working memory performance, they were tested with a digit span test and a visuo-spatial measure. Only one of our two dependent variables reflected a relationship between specific profiles of ICT use and working memory. Higher scores on the digits span test were related to those user profiles combining PC use and video game play, that is, those identified as Full users and as PC and Console Gamers. We did not find an interaction effect of gender and ICT use or an interaction effect of socioeconomic level and ICT use. There are three possible explanations for these results: first, a proclivity of students with higher working memory capacity to engage in technology use; second, an impact on working memory of potential differences in multitasking; and, third, an impact on working memory of video game play. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously since scores on the GEFT, our visuo-spatial working memory measure, were not related to any profile of technology use. As serious educational games become more regularly used at school, previous differences in video game experience become growingly important. Future research must study whether the intended benefits of serious educational games are being mediated by individual differences in previous exposure to video games and other information and computer technologies, with independence of the directionality of the relationship between video game play and working memory. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, priming the stereotype of soccer hooligans or the trait stupid reduced participants' performance on a general knowledge scale. Results of the experiments revealed (a) that prolonged priming leads to more pronounced behavioral effects and (b) that there is no sign of decay of the effects for at least 15 min. The authors explain their results by claiming that perception had a direct and pervasive impact on overt behavior (cf. J.A. Bargh, M. Chen, & L. Burrows, 1996).

abstract = { It has long been known that pupils - the apertures that allow light
into the eyes - dilate and constrict not only in response to changes
in ambient light but also in response to emotional changes and arousing
stimuli (e.g., Fontana, 1765). Charles Darwin (1872) related changes
in pupil diameter to fear and other �emotions� in animals. For decades,
pupillometry has been used to study cognitive processing across many
domains, including perception, language, visual search, and short-term
memory. Historically, such studies have examined the pupillary reflex
as a correlate of attentional demands imposed by different tasks
or stimuli - pupils typically dilate as cognitive demand increases.
Because the neural mechanisms responsible for such task-evoked pupillary
reflexes (TEPRs) implicate a role for memory processes, recent studies
have examined pupillometry as a tool for investigating the cognitive
processes underlying the creation of new episodic memories and their
later retrieval. Here, we review the historical antecedents of current
pupillometric research and discuss several recent studies linking
pupillary dilation to the on-line consumption of cognitive resources
in long-term-memory tasks. We conclude by discussing the future role
of pupillometry in memory research and several methodological considerations
that are important when designing pupillometric studies.},

defense (Studies 1-3) and self-esteem striving (Study 5), yet more
mindful individuals did not defend a constellation of values theoretically
associated with mindfulness (Study 4). To explain these findings
through proximal defense processes, Study 6 showed that more mindful
individuals wrote about their death for a longer period of time,
which partially mediated the inverse association between trait mindfulness
and worldview defense. Study 7 demonstrated that trait mindfulness
predicted less suppression of death thoughts immediately following
MS. The discussion highlights the relevance of mindfulness to theories
that emphasize the nature of conscious processing in understanding
responses to threat.},

@article{Rukanuddin2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Traditionally, nursing care has been described as performing
nursing tasks and often focused on nurses carrying out doctors' orders.
In many countries of the world, including Pakistan, nurses do not
document care in a standardized manner. Because of this limitation
many health administrators, policy makers, and consumers make inadequate
assumptions about nursing work, often regarding nurses as any other
'health care technician' who can be easily replaced by more economical
health care workers. PURPOSE To overcome this problem, standardized
documentation is being introduced into the Aga Khan University School
of Nursing and hospital, Aga Khan Health Services, Public Health
School in Karachi, and government colleges of nursing, using the
International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP). The purpose
of this paper is to highlight the process of introducing and developing
standardized nursing care plans (NCP) using ICNP in Pakistan. PROCESS
The process for introducing ICNP consists of four components, including
administrative planning, development, teaching and training, and
testing. Subsets of the ICNP for (i) maternity: antenatal, postnatal
and natal care; and (ii) cardiology were developed using standardized
NCPs. The subsets were developed by nurse experts and introduced
at the testing sites. The testing will be conducted as a pilot project.
Findings from the pilot will be used to continue and expand standardized
nursing documentation using the ICNP across Pakistan. CONCLUSION
Through this project, nurses, midwives and lady health visitors (midwives,
vaccinator and health educators) will test standardization of documentation
and begin to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of clinical practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients seeking emergency and urgent care tend to experience a system, making choices about which service to use and making use of a number of services within a healthcare episode. The aim was to psychometrically test the Urgent Care System Questionnaire (UCSQ) for the routine measurement of the patient perspective of the emergency and urgent care system. METHODS: The UCSQ was developed based on qualitative research with recent users of the system. It consisted of a screening question to identify recent users and questions on the patient experience of, and satisfaction with, their most recent event. The acceptability, validity and reliability of the UCSQ were tested in a postal survey of 900 members of the general population and a telephone survey of a quota sample of 1000 members of the general population. RESULTS: The response rate to the postal survey was 51% (457/893). In the telephone survey, 11604 calls were made to obtain a quota sample of 1014 people. These surveys identified 250 system users in the previous 3 months. A principal-components analysis identified three satisfaction components with good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha between 0.7 and 0.93): 'progress through the system' (10 items), 'entry into the system' (three items) and 'patient convenience' (five items). These components varied as expected by age and overall rating of the system. CONCLUSION: Preliminary testing suggests that the UCSQ has reasonable acceptability, validity and reliability. Further testing is required, particularly its responsiveness to changes in emergency and urgent care systems.},

What are your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses? Equally important, how do you learn and work with others? What are your most deeply held values? And in what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution?

Systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses of published data, and meta-analyses of individual data (pooled reanalyses) are now being published with increasing frequency. We here describe the essential features of these methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nMETHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search. The different types of review and meta-analysis are described, the methods used in each are outlined so that they can be evaluated, and a checklist is given for the assessment of reviews and meta-analyses of scientific articles.\n\nRESULTS: Systematic literature reviews provide an overview of the state of research on a given topic and enable an assessment of the quality of individual studies. They also allow the results of different studies to be evaluated together when these are inconsistent. Meta-analyses additionally allow calculation of pooled estimates of an effect. The different types of review and meta-analysis are discussed with examples from the literature on one particular topic.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses enable the research findings and treatment effects obtained in different individual studies to be summed up and evaluated.},

abstract = {Background: There are well-defined and characteristic age-related
deficits in motor abilities that may reflect structural and chemical
changes in the aging brain.Objective: To delineate age-related changes
in the physiology of brain systems subserving simple motor behavior.Methods:
Ten strongly right-handed young (<35 years of age) and 12 strongly
right-handed elderly (>50 years of age) subjects with no evidence
of cognitive or motor deficits participated in the study. Whole-brain
functional imaging was performed on a 1.5-T MRI scanner using a spiral
pulse sequence while the subjects performed a visually paced “button-press��?
motor task with their dominant right hand alternating with a rest
state.Results: Although the groups did not differ in accuracy, there
was an increase in reaction time in the elderly subjects (mean score
± SD, young subjects = 547 ± 97 ms, elderly subjects = 794 ± 280
ms, p < 0.03). There was a greater extent of activation in the contralateral
sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor area, supplementary motor area,
and ipsilateral cerebellum in the elderly subjects relative to the
young subjects (p < 0.001). Additional areas of activation, absent
in the young subjects, were seen in the ipsilateral sensorimotor
cortex, putamen (left > right), and contralateral cerebellum of the
elderly subjects.Conclusions: The results of this study show that
elderly subjects recruit additional cortical and subcortical areas
even for the performance of a simple motor task. These changes may
represent compensatory mechanisms invoked by the aging brain, such
as reorganization and redistribution of functional networks to compensate
for age-related structural and neurochemical changes.},

Our results indicate that mindfulness is inversely related to disturbed dreaming and predicts less severe dream disturbances after controlling for trait anxiety. Moreover, the results of the applied hierarchical regression analysis suggest that mindfulness is associated with reduced dream anxiety by moderating the extent of waking anxiety. Our findings extend previous research relating mindfulness, emotional regulation and sleep quality to the domain of dream research. We suggest that mindfulness is a possible protective factor against dream disturbances.},

in clinical nursing, healthcare management, education and research
have been identified. NMDS systems have been developed in a number
of countries, with applications mostly related to resource allocation.
To date, NMDS systems have tended to examine physical nursing care

This is necessary to keep medical knowledge up to date and to ensure optimal patient care. The aim of this paper is to present an accessible introduction into critical appraisal of scientific articles. METHODS: Using a selection of international literature, the reader is introduced to the principles of critical reading of scientific articles in medicine. For the sake of conciseness, detailed description of statistical methods is omitted. RESULTS: Widely accepted principles for critically appraising scientific articles are outlined. Basic knowledge of study design, structuring of an article, the role of different sections, of statistical presentations as well as sources of error and limitation are presented. The reader does not require extensive methodological knowledge. As far as necessary for critical appraisal of scientific articles, differences in research areas like epidemiology, clinical, and basic research are outlined. Further useful references are presented. CONCLUSION: Basic methodological knowledge is required to select and interpret scientific articles correctly.},

abstract = {Functional activity in the visual cortex was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology while participants viewed a series of pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant pictures. Coronal images at four different locations in the occipital cortex were acquired during each of eight 12-s picture presentation periods (on) and 12-s interpicture interval (off). The extent of functional activation was larger in the right than the left hemisphere and larger in the occipital than in the occipitoparietal regions during processing of all picture contents compared with the interpicture intervals. More importantly, functional activity was significantly greater in all sampled brain regions when processing emotional (pleasant or unpleasant) pictures than when processing neutral stimuli. In Experiment 2, a hypothesis that these differences were an artifact of differential eye movements was ruled out. Whereas both emotional and neutral pictures produced activity centered on the calcarine fissure (Area 17), only emotional pictures also produced sizable clusters bilaterally in the occipital gyrus, in the right fusiform gyrus, and in the right inferior and superior parietal lobules.},

abstract = {Traditional accounts of verbal short-term memory explain differences in performance for different types of verbal material by reference to inherent characteristics of the verbal items making up memory sequences. The role of previous experience with sequences of different types is ostensibly controlled for either by deliberate exclusion or by presenting multiple trials constructed from different random permutations. We cast doubt on this general approach in a detailed analysis of the basis for the robust finding that short-term memory for digit sequences is superior to that for other sequences of verbal material. Specifically, we show across four experiments that this advantage is not due to inherent characteristics of digits as verbal items, nor are individual digits within sequences better remembered than other types of individual verbal items. Rather, the advantage for digit sequences stems from the increased frequency, compared to other verbal material, with which digits appear in random sequences in natural language, and furthermore, relatively frequent digit sequences support better short-term serial recall than less frequent ones. We also provide corpus-based computational support for the argument that performance in a short-term memory setting is a function of basic associative learning processes operating on the linguistic experience of the rememberer. The experimental and computational results raise questions not only about the role played by measurement of digit span in cognition generally, but also about the way in which long-term memory processes impact on short-term memory functioning.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a leading health threat. Determination of optimal therapies for long-term weight loss remains a challenge. Evidence suggests that successful weight loss depends on the compliance of weight loss program participants with their weight loss efforts. Despite this, little is known regarding the attributes influencing such compliance. The purpose of this study was to assess, using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), the relative importance of weight loss program attributes to its participants and to express these preferences in terms of their willingness to pay for them.

RESEARCH METHODS: A DCE survey explored the following weight loss program attributes in a sample of 165 overweight adults enrolled in community weight loss programs: cost, travel time required to attend, extent of physician involvement (e.g., none, monthly, every 2 weeks), components (e.g., diet, exercise, behavior change) emphasized, and focus (e.g., group, individual). The rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes and the willingness to pay for different configurations of combined attributes were estimated using regression modeling.

RESULTS: All attributes investigated appeared to be statistically significant. The most important unit change was "program components emphasized" (e.g., moving from diet only to diet and exercise).

DISCUSSION: The majority of participants were willing to pay for weight loss programs that reflected their preferences. The DCE tool was useful in quantifying and understanding individual preferences in obesity management and provided information that could help to maximize the efficiency of existing weight loss programs or the design of new programs.},

abstract = {<p>Background<br/>The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self
Report (IDS-SR) is a widely used but heterogeneous measure of depression
severity. Insight in its factor structure and dimensionality could
help to develop more homogeneous IDS-SR subscales. However previous
factoranalytical studies have found mixed results. Therefore, the
present study tested which factor structure underlies the IDS-SR
and, in addition, if the factors can be used as unidimensional subscales.Methods<br/>Confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) was done to identify the best-fitting factor
structure. The study sample consisted of 2600 individuals (mean age
40.5 ± 12.1). We assessed model fit in 4 groups: 957 Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD) patients, 450 remitted MDD patients, 570 patients
with an anxiety disorder and 623 healthy controls to test the consistency
of model fit. Rasch analyses in the full sample were used to evaluate
and optimize the unidimensionality and psychometric quality of the
factors.Results<br/>CFA indicated that a 3-factor model fits the
IDS-SR data best and is consistent across groups, with a [`]mood/cognition'
factor, an [`]anxiety/arousal' factor and a [`]sleep' factor. In
addition, Rasch analyses indicated that the [`]mood/cognition' and
[`]anxiety/arousal' factors could be optimized to be used as unidimensional
subscales.Limitations<br/>The fit of only 4 models was tested, ranging
from a 1- to 4-factor model.Conclusions<br/>The IDS-SR is a heterogeneous
instrument with a multifactorial underlying structure. It is possible
to measure more homogeneous symptomatology with IDS-SR subscales,
which could be useful in clinical practice and scientific research.</p>},

Our analysis of data from the popular Web site HOTorNOT.com suggests that this is not the case: Less attractive people do not delude themselves into thinking that their dates are more physically attractive than others perceive them to be. Furthermore, the results also show that males, compared with females, are less affected by their own attractiveness when choosing whom to date.},

In the experiment, one individual is selected based on a particular procedure. This individual is allowed to propose how to allocate a pie among five group members: herself and four responders. Then each responder in the group can decide whether to offer costly resistance to the proposed allocation. Resistance is modeled as a threshold public good. If the resistance is successful, the proposer receives nothing. If resistance is unsuccessful, the pie is distributed according to the proposer's decision. We find that resistance increases with (a) the size of the proposal, with (b) subjectively perceived unfairness of the selection procedure for the proposer's role, and with (c) the individual procedural preferences being unsatisfied. Surprisingly, resistance is not affected by whether the group's majority vote on the selection procedure is respected. We check for the robustness of our results and find that the results are stable over two countries. The presented evidence suggests that procedural effects over and above outcomes are relevant in strategic interaction.},

Most studies focused on one joint rather than including all relevant

a tremendous burden to patients in nursing homes, hospitals, and

abstract = {A study by Jaeggi and her colleagues (2008) claimed that they were able to improve fluid intelligence (gf) by training working memory. Subjects who trained their working memory on a dual n-back task for a period of time showed significant improvements in working memory span tasks and fluid intelligence tests such as the Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Bochumer Matrices Test (BOMAT) after training compared to those without training. The current study aimed to replicate and extend the original study conducted by Jaeggi et al. (2008) in a well-controlled experiment that could explain the cause or causes of such transfer if indeed the case. There were a total of 93 participants who completed the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups—a passive control group, active control group and experimental group. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the 8-day condition and the other half to the 20-day condition. All participants completed a battery of tests at pre- and post-tests that consisted of short timed tests, a complex working memory span and a matrix reasoning task. Participants in the active control group practiced for either 8 days or 20 days on the same task as the one used in the experimental group, the dual n-back, but at the easiest level to control for Hawthorne effect. Results from the current study did not suggest any significant improvement in the mental abilities tested, especially fluid intelligence and working memory capacity, after training for 8 days or 20 days. This leads to the conclusion that increasing one's working memory capacity by training and practice did not transfer to improvement on fluid intelligence as asserted by Jaeggi and her colleagues (2008, 2010).

abstract = {The Millean Quantity Objection—that is, the claim that the measurement of psychological attributes is impossible (Trendler, 2009)—has been countered with partly vigorous opposition (Kyngdon, 2013; Markus & Borsboom, 2012; Saint-Mont, 2012). Kyngdon's response is of particular interest, since he asserts that measurement may already have been established. If correct, it would definitely invalidate any quantity objection and end the century-long discussion about the measurability of psychological attributes. Therefore the focus of the rejoinder will be on the question of when measurement is reached. First the meaning of measurement is elaborated. On this basis, criteria for the successful establishment of measurement are formulated and it is outlined how these are satisfied in the case of intensive quantities. It is concluded that the evidence presented by Kyngdon is insufficient and inadequate. The approach will also serve as background to discuss objections raised against the Millean Quantity Objection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Detailed evidence for the construct validity of stress questionnaires has been repeatedly demanded. This study aimed to investigate the construct validity of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) in the context of a transactional view of stress.

METHODS: The examination was based on the PSQ and on standardized quality of life and personality questionnaires. The analyses focused on structural equation modeling. A total of 2552 subjects from a population-based survey were studied.

RESULTS: A transactional model fitted the data. Personality aspects and resources contribute to the total perceived stress. Yet the physical aspects of quality of life receive a comparatively low weighting. The prevalence of perceived stress at a moderate level was estimated to be 14.5%, lowest in the age group>75 years and highest in the 35- to 54-year age group. The prevalence of high stress was 3.1%. The total PSQ-30 score of the general population was 0.30 (S.D.=0.15), slightly higher in women than in men.

CONCLUSION: We consider the PSQ as a valid instrument for recording subjective perceived stress in the context of a transactional view of stress. The present broad and international database suggests that it needs further investigation in terms of transcultural studies.},

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ‘‘tested'' a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

that acceptance has a positive effect upon fatigue and psychological

to more emotional stability and less psychological distress, beyond
the effects of demographic variables, and fatigue severity.Conclusion
We suggest that promoting acceptance in patients with CFS may often
be more beneficial than trying to control largely uncontrollable

abstract = {We examined the neural basis of self-regulation in individuals from a cohort of preschoolers who performed the delay-of-gratification task 4 decades ago. Nearly 60 individuals, now in their mid-forties, were tested on "hot" and "cool" versions of a go/nogo task to assess whether delay of gratification in childhood predicts impulse control abilities and sensitivity to alluring cues (happy faces). Individuals who were less able to delay gratification in preschool and consistently showed low self-control abilities in their twenties and thirties performed more poorly than did high delayers when having to suppress a response to a happy face but not to a neutral or fearful face. This finding suggests that sensitivity to environmental hot cues plays a significant role in individuals' ability to suppress actions toward such stimuli. A subset of these participants (n = 26) underwent functional imaging for the first time to test for biased recruitment of frontostriatal circuitry when required to suppress responses to alluring cues. Whereas the prefrontal cortex differentiated between nogo and go trials to a greater extent in high delayers, the ventral striatum showed exaggerated recruitment in low delayers. Thus, resistance to temptation as measured originally by the delay-of-gratification task is a relatively stable individual difference that predicts reliable biases in frontostriatal circuitries that integrate motivational and control processes.},

abstract = {Multiple outcome measures are often used in clinical research and practice. However, the use of multiple measures inflates the probability of a type I error. In this paper, we used factor analysis techniques to reduce multiple outcome measures to a lesser number of orthogonal dimensions. The data were obtained from 119 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each patient had measurements made of 28 variables, including multiple parameters of pulmonary function, exercise tolerance and gas exchange. Factor analysis using a maximum likelihood iterative solution was performed. The factors were then rotated to a varimax solution. The analysis yielded four meaningful factors: exercise tolerance, disease severity, lung volumes and flow rates. Exercise tolerance and disease severity were the most important factors accounting, respectively, for 44 and 13 % of the common variance. For further analyses, these composite factors could be used or a representative clinical measure from each factor might be chosen. We conclude that many physiologic measures provide highly correlated information about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Factor analysis may help reduce these measures into a smaller number of reliable composites},

Although these cross-sectional studies are informative, cause and effect are impossible to establish without longitudinal investigation of the same individuals before and after an intervention. Several longitudinal studies have been conducted (e.g., [9-18]); some involved children or young adults, potentially conflating brain development with learning, most were restricted to the motor domain, and all concerned relatively short timescales (weeks or months). Here, by contrast, we utilized a unique opportunity to study average-IQ adults operating in the real world as they learned, over four years, the complex layout of London's streets while training to become licensed taxi drivers. In those who qualified, acquisition of an internal spatial representation of London was associated with a selective increase in gray matter (GM) volume in their posterior hippocampi and concomitant changes to their memory profile. No structural brain changes were observed in trainees who failed to qualify or control participants. We conclude that specific, enduring, structural brain changes in adult humans can be induced by biologically relevant behaviors engaging higher cognitive functions such as spatial memory, with significance for the "nature versus nurture" debate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adequacy
of the International Classification of Nursing Practice (1) (ICPN)
Version 1.0 as a representational model for nursing assessment documentation.
DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS To identify representational requirements
of nursing assessments, the authors mapped key concepts and semantic
relations extracted from standardized and local nursing admission
assessment documentation forms/templates and inpatient admission
assessment records to the ICNP. Next, they expanded the list of ICNP
semantic relations with those obtained from the admission assessment
forms/templates. The expanded ICNP semantic relations were then validated
against the semantic relations identified from an additional set
of admission assessment records and a set of 300 randomly selected
North American Nursing Diagnosis Association defining characteristic
phrases. The concept coverage of the ICNP was evaluated by mapping
the concepts extracted from these sources to the ICNP concepts. The
UMLS Methathesaurus was then used to map concepts without exact matches
to other American Nursing Association (ANA) recognized terminologies.
RESULTS The authors found that along with the 30 existing ICNP semantic
relations, an additional 17 are required for the ICNP to function
as a representational model for nursing assessment documentation.
Eight hundred and five unique assessment concepts were extracted
from all sources. Forty-three percent of these unique assessment
concepts had exact matches in the ICNP. An additional 20% had matches
in the ICNP classified as narrower, broader, or "other." Of the concepts
without exact matches in the ICNP, 81% had exact matches found in
other ANA recognized terminologies. CONCLUSIONS The broad concept
coverage and the logic-based structure of the ICNP make it a flexible
and robust standard. The ICNP provides a framework from which to
capture and reuse atomic level data to facilitate evidence-based
practice.},

abstract = {Traditionally believed to be the result of maladaptive development, bullying perpetration is increasingly being viewed as a potentially adaptive behavior. We were interested in determining whether adolescents who bully others enjoy a key evolutionary benefit: increased dating and mating (sexual) opportunities. This hypothesis was tested in two independent samples consisting of 334 adolescents and 144 university students. The data partly supported our prediction that bullying, but not victimization, would predict dating behavior. The data for sexual behavior more clearly supported our hypothesis that bullying behavior predicts an increase in sexual opportunities even when accounting for age, sex, and self-reports of attractiveness, likeability, and peer victimization. These results are generally congruent with the hypothesis that bullying perpetration is, at least in part, an evolutionary adaptive behavior. },

abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

The authors conducted interviews and measured coping and well-being. Qualitative interviews indicated that subjects had attained more awareness of work-related problems contributing to stress and had grown more critical toward their work environment. In the treatment group, positive strategies of coping with stress increased and negative strategies of coping decreased (significant difference at post treatment: p .039 compared to control). Eighty-two percent of the participants reported having reached their personal goal.},

abstract = {Summary. This paper puts forward an overall view of statistics. It is argued that statistics is the study of uncertainty. The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and law. The paper has been written in the hope that it will be intelligible to all who are interested in statistics},

Two mechanisms allow for such self-concept maintenance: inattention to moral standards and categorization malleability.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine what aspects of healthcare provision are most likely to influence satisfaction with care and willingness to recommend hospital services to others and, secondly, to explore the extent to which satisfaction is a meaningful indicator of patient experience of healthcare services. DESIGN: Postal survey of a sample of patients who underwent a period of inpatient care. Patients were asked to evaluate their overall experience of this episode of care and to complete the Picker Inpatient Survey questionnaire on specific aspects of their care. SAMPLE: Patients aged 18 and over presenting at five hospitals within one NHS trust in Scotland. METHOD: 3592 questionnaires were mailed to patients' homes within 1 month of discharge from hospital during a 12 month period. Two reminders were sent to non-responders; 2249 (65%) questionnaires were returned. RESULTS: Almost 90% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their period of inpatient care. Age and overall self-assessed health were only weakly associated with satisfaction. A multiple linear regression indicated that the major determinants of patient satisfaction were physical comfort, emotional support, and respect for patient preferences. However, many patients who reported their satisfaction with the care they received also indicated problems with their inpatient care as measured on the Picker Inpatient Survey; 55% of respondents who rated their inpatient episode as "excellent" indicated problems on 10% of the issues measured on the Picker questionnaire. DISCUSSION: The evidence suggests that patient satisfaction scores present a limited and optimistic picture. Detailed questions about specific aspects of patients' experiences are likely to be more useful for monitoring the performance of various hospital departments and wards and could point to ways in which delivery of health care could be improved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the immediate and medium-term effects of three
stretching methods on the knee flexion range in people with a total
knee replacement. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Rehabilitation
hospital. SUBJECTS: 117 patients were recruited and 100 (mean age:
68.43 +/- 7.95 years) of them completed the study. INTERVENTIONS:
Patients receiving total knee replacement due to knee osteoarthritis
were randomly assigned into 3 groups of: active stretching (group
1, n =32), passive stretching (group 2, n =35) and proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation stretching (group 3, n =33). MAIN MEASURES:
The immediate change in both active and passive knee flexion range
after the first treatment session and the pattern of change in these
ranges throughout the 2-week study period were compared among the
three groups. RESULTS: All groups demonstrated significant improvement
in knee ranges with time. The active range of group 1 improved by
19.9 degrees , group 2 by 25.3 degrees and group 3 by 22.5 degrees
throughout the 2-week period, whereas the improvements in the passive
range were 18.8 degrees , 24.5 degrees and 22.7 degrees , respectively.
For between-group comparisons, no significant difference was found
in both active (P = 0.647) and passive (P = 0.501) knee range immediately
after stretching. For the changes at 2 weeks, there was also no significant
difference among the groups in both active (P = 0.716) and passive
(P = 0.959) knee ranges. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that all
three modes of stretching were associated with an increase in the
knee flexion range of patients after total knee replacement, with
no statistically significant differences between the changes seen.},

abstract = {Despite the long history of therapeutic experience with different
types and amounts of passive joint motion, its effects and the principles
of its use remain controversial. Through empiric success, a spectrum
of passive motion has evolved for various clinical purposes, including
joint diagnosis; correction of joint deformities; mobilization of
stiff joints; stimulation of joint healing; neuromuscular re-education;
and prevention of immobilization complications (e.g., contracture
formation, connective tissue atrophy, relative healing inhibition,
and associated stasis abnormalities). However, the potential abuses
of passive motion (e.g., causing additional tissue trauma, mobilizing
unprotected joints, and stretching the wrong joints or tissues) have
created serious doubts as to the value of this therapy and raised
important questions concerning the lack of proper definition (e.g.,
force, direction, speed, and duration) and the unknown margins of
safety. Clinical and experimental evidence supports the probable
effectiveness of passive joint motion on joint and tissue levels,
but without a better quantitative understanding of the mechanisms
of action, dose-responsiveness, specific tissue effects, and, most
important, their controls. Thus, passive motion will continue to
be used suboptimally with inconsistent results. When these clinical
and research deficiencies are corrected, passive motion will attain
its proper place as a powerful and reliable orthopedic tool.},

abstract = {<p><br/>The present study was designed to identify prospectively the
individual chronic characteristics associated with falling among
elderly persons and to test the hypothesis that risk of falling increases
as the number of chronic disabilities increases. Seventy-nine consecutive
admissions to three intermediate care facilities were evaluated.
Twenty-five of the subjects became recurrent fallers. The nine risk
factors included in the fall risk index were mobility score, morale
score, mental status score, distant vision, hearing, postural blood
pressure, results of back examination, postadmission medications,
and admission activities of daily living score. A subject's fall
risk score was the number of index factors present. The proportions
of recurrent falters increased from 0 percent (0 of 30) in those
with 0 to three risk factors, to 31 percent (11 of 35) in those with
four to six factors, to 100 percent (14 of 14) in those with seven
or more factors. Falling, at least among some elderly persons, appears
to result from the accumulated effect of multiple specific disabilities.
Some of these disabilities may be remediable. The mobility test,
the best single predictor of recurrent falling, may be useful clinically
because it is simple, recreates fall situations, and provides a dynamic,
integrated assessment of mobility.</p>},

abstract = {The standard model of labor is one in which individuals trade their time and energy in return for monetary rewards. Building on Fiske's relational theory (1992), we propose that there are two types of markets that determine relationships between effort and payment: monetary and social. We hypothesize that monetary markets are highly sensitive to the magnitude of compensation, whereas social markets are not. This perspective can shed light on the well-established observation that people sometimes expend more effort in exchange for no payment (a social market) than they expend when they receive low payment (a monetary market). Three experiments support these ideas. The experimental evidence also demonstrates that mixed markets (markets that include aspects of both social and monetary markets) more closely resemble monetary than social markets.},

Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data.

Differential activity was found for emotional, compared to neutral, pictures at both of the P3 intervals, as well as enhancement of later posterior positivity. Source space projection was performed using a minimum norm procedure that estimates the source currents generating the extracranially measured electrical gradient.

Most of what is understood about trait mindfulness comes from administering the MAAS to relatively homogenous samples of Caucasian adults. This study rigorously evaluates the psychometric properties of the MAAS among Chinese adolescents attending high school in Chengdu, China. Classrooms from 24 schools were randomly selected to participate in the study. Three waves of longitudinal data (N = 5,287 students) were analyzed. MAAS construct, nomological, and incremental validity were evaluated as well as its measurement invariance across gender using latent factor analyses. Participants' mean age was 16.2 years (SD = 0.7), and 51% were male. The 15-item MAAS had adequate fit to the one-dimensional factor structure at Wave 1, and this factor structure was replicated at Wave 2. A 6-item short scale of the MAAS fit well to the data at Wave 3. The MAAS maintained reliability (Cronbach's $\alpha$ = .89-.93; test-restest r = .35-.52), convergent/discriminant validity, and explained additional variance in mental health measures beyond other psychosocial constructs. Both the 15- and 6-item MAAS scales displayed at least partial factorial invariance across gender. The findings suggest that the MAAS is a sound measure of trait mindfulness among Chinese adolescents. To reduce respondent burden, the MAAS 6-item short-scale provides an option to measure trait mindfulness.},

We conclude that mindfulness brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation. The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and suggested directions for future research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many questions in human health research can only be answered with observational studies. In contrast to controlled experiments or well-planned, experimental randomized clinical trials, observational studies are subject to a number of potential problems that may bias their results. METHODS: Some of the more important problems affecting observational studies are described and illustrated by examples. Additional information is provided with reference to a selection of the literature. RESULTS: Factors that may bias the results of observational studies can be broadly categorized as: selection bias resulting from the way study subjects are recruited or from differing rates of study participation depending on the subjects' cultural background, age, or socioeconomic status, information bias, measurement error, confounders, and further factors. CONCLUSIONS: Observational studies make an important contribution to medical knowledge. The main methodological problems can be avoided by careful study planning. An understanding of the potential pitfalls is important in order to critically assess relevant publications.},

@article{Jiang2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND With increasing computerization of nursing records in Japan,
standardization of nursing terminology is becoming imperative. Although
some efforts have been made to formalize description of nursing practice
in Japan with the International Classification of Nursing Practice
(ICNP), lack of effective description tools has impacted negatively
on the initiatives. PURPOSE To develop and evaluate an ontological
approach that could be used to facilitate the description of nursing
practice in Japan with the ICNP. METHODOLOGY An ontology-based support
system was developed using Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}}-2000, mainly by the following
three steps: (1) representing a standard classification of nursing
practice (the Nursing Master) in Japan; (2) representing a Japanese
version of the ICNP; (3) designing an ontology-based framework. A
heuristic matching algorithm was developed to automatically match
the action labels in the Nursing Master with the terms of the eight
axes of the ICNP Nursing Actions Classification. A preliminary evaluation
was performed to examine the usefulness of the system. RESULTS High
hit rate was shown on the ICNP axes ActionType, Target, and Location.
The evaluation indicated that 51.7+/-5.8% (mean+/-S.D.) of the action
labels with only one action type were properly matched, and that
in 80+/-4% (mean+/-S.D.) of action labels with more than one action
type, at least one valid action type was matched correctly. CONCLUSION
The ontology-based approach using a frame-based knowledge representation
system (e.g., Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}}-2000) is useful for supporting the formal
description of nursing practice in Japan with the ICNP.},

Design Observational, prospective, 24-h cross-sectional study with self-reporting. Setting Seventy-nine intensive care units at 76 hospitals. Measurements Number of events, risk of AEs and NHEs, types of incidents, severity and avoidability of incidents. Results A total of 1017 patients were included in the study; 591 (58%) were affected by one or more incidents. Of the 1424 valid incidents, 943 (66%) were NHEs and 481 (34%) were AEs. The individual risk of suffering at least one incident was 62%, at least one NHE 45% and at least one AE 29%. The median number of incidents, NHEs and AEs was 6, 3 and 2 per 100 patient-hours, respectively. Seventy-four per cent of the incidents were related to medication (24%), equipment (15%), nursing care (14%), accidental withdrawal of vascular accesses and catheters (10%) or airways and mechanical ventilation (10%). AEs resulted in temporary damage in 29% and in permanent damage or damage that compromised patients' lives or contributed to their death in 4%. Incidents were avoidable in 79% of cases (90% in NHEs and 60% in AEs, P < 0.05). Conclusions The individual risk for incidents in critical patients is high. Many incidents did not harm patients, some caused damage and a few were related to the patient's death. Most incidents were considered avoidable.},

@article{Grogan2000,
abstract = {Background—In order that patient satisfaction may be assessed in
a meaningful way, measures that are valid and reliable are required.
This study was undertaken to assess the construct validity and internal
reliability of the previously developed Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire
(PSQ).Method—A total of 1390 patients from five practices in the
North of England, the Midlands, and Scotland completed the questionnaire.
Responses were checked for construct validity (including confirmatory
factor analysis to check the factor structure of the scale) and internal
reliability.Results—Confirmatory factor analysis showed that items
loaded on the appropriate factors in a five factor model (doctors,
nurses, access, appointments, and facilities). Scores on the specific
subscales showed highly significant positive correlations with general
satisfaction subscale scores suggesting construct validity. Also,
the prediction (derived from past research) that older people would
be more satisfied with the service was borne out by the results (F
(4, 1312) = 57.10; p<0.0001), providing further construct validation.
The five specific subscales (doctors, nurses, access, appointments,
and facilities), the general satisfaction subscale, and the questionnaire
as a whole were found to have high internal reliability (Cronbach's
$\alpha$ = 0.74–0.95).Conclusion—The results suggest that the PSQ is
a valid and internally reliable tool for assessing patient satisfaction
with general practitioner services. (Quality in Health Care 2000;9:210–215)},

It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

A global access scale and an overall dental satisfaction index were also constructed. Scale scores are sufficiently reliable to be used to compare different groups of patients or to study one group over time. Several lines of evidence support the validity of scale scores. Taken together, the results suggest that the DSQ will be useful in general population studies of dental care attitudes, and that dentists may do a better job than physicians in satisfying their patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An understanding of p-values and confidence intervals is necessary for the evaluation of scientific articles. This article will inform the reader of the meaning and interpretation of these two statistical concepts.

METHODS: The uses of these two statistical concepts and the differences between them are discussed on the basis of a selective literature search concerning the methods employed in scientific articles.

RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: P-values in scientific studies are used to determine whether a null hypothesis formulated before the performance of the study is to be accepted or rejected. In exploratory studies, p-values enable the recognition of any statistically noteworthy findings. Confidence intervals provide information about a range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of probability, as well as about the direction and strength of the demonstrated effect. This enables conclusions to be drawn about the statistical plausibility and clinical relevance of the study findings. It is often useful for both statistical measures to be reported in scientific articles, because they provide complementary types of information.},

Subjects are given an individual endowment and vote by majority rule to either keep the endowment for private use or to donate it to a non-governmental organization. In our experiment, participants are divided at random in two treatments. Individuals in both treatments are provided with true yet diverging information regarding the approval rates observed in previous experimental sessions. Our results show that the voting behavior differs across treatments in a way that is consistent with bandwagon voting. They also confirm the importance of instrumental motives and – unlike the majority of previous experiments – find support for expressive voting motives. Finally, we assess the impact of the false-consensus effect from a theoretical perspective. We show that it has the potential to change voter behavior if it results from an anchoring bias and voters follow non-instrumental motives.},

@article{Creswell2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness is a process whereby one is aware and receptive to present moment experiences. Although mindfulness-enhancing interventions reduce pathological mental and physical health symptoms across a wide variety of conditions and diseases, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Converging evidence from the mindfulness and neuroscience literature suggests that labeling affect may be one mechanism for these effects.

METHODS: Participants (n = 27) indicated trait levels of mindfulness and then completed an affect labeling task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The labeling task consisted of matching facial expressions to appropriate affect words (affect labeling) or to gender-appropriate names (gender labeling control task).

RESULTS: After controlling for multiple individual difference measures, dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation, and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling, compared with the gender labeling control task. Further, strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in mindfulness.

CONCLUSIONS: The present findings with a dispositional measure of mindfulness suggest one potential neurocognitive mechanism for understanding how mindfulness meditation interventions reduce negative affect and improve health outcomes, showing that mindfulness is associated with enhanced prefrontal cortical regulation of affect through labeling of negative affective stimuli.},

abstract = {In the social and economic sciences, there has been a trend towards assigning individual pref- erences and values greater importance in establishing the microanalytical foundations for a theory of human action. This development can also be observed for the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey, which in recent years has also been expanded to include several psy- chological indicators. The Machiavellianism and Egoism Scales were integrated into the 2006 SOEP Pretest, which was carried out in preparation for future waves of the main survey, pro- viding the opportunity to test two more individual values relevant to action for their applica- bility to the SOEP standard battery of questions. The goal is to generate short item scales on the basis of established inventories that meet psychometric standards and are also connected with everyday action indicators. The three-item inventories developed display only moderate internal coherence but show the intended factor structure. Additionally, the short scales are also able to replicate the results of the original inventories. All in all, there is little evidence that the preferences under study are connected with socio-demographic characteristics; rather, they can be linked to personality indicators. Overall, we can observe the assumed connections to everyday life indicators in the expected direction, but their validity is limited by the size of the effect.},

abstract = {To promote student engagement, professors must actively seek to create the conditions that foster engagement. Chickering and Gamson (1987) suggest that good practices in undergraduate education are ones that: encourage student-faculty contact, develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, encourage active learning, provide students with prompt feedback, emphasize time on task, communicate high expectations and respect diverse talents and ways of knowing. The purpose of the book is to provide the reader with a variety of techniques that can be used to foster student engagement. The techniques include ways to enhance the level of academic challenge, promote active and collaborative learning, increase student-faculty interaction, provide enriching educational experiences, and create supportive learning environments. The book is divided into six sections. The first section describes factors that promote student engagement and the learning outcomes related to student engagement. The second and third sections describe programs that promote student engagement and include programs that can be implemented at the course level, programs that can be offered by a department, programs that provide for community involvement, institution-wide programs, as well as national programs. Instructors can enhance student engagement by encouraging students to become more active participants in their education. Section 4 of the book provides a number of techniques that can be used to promote active participation in the classroom. Several opportunities for student engagement are described in Section 5. The final section of the book describes several innovative approaches on how to assess student engagement.

abstract = {Mindfulness is defined as non-judgmental present-moment attention and awareness, which varies across persons and moments. As a non-judgmental stance, mindfulness should allow for greater perceptual objectivity. Previous research suggests that self-interest can motivate people to “see what they want to see” (Balcetis & Dunning, 2006). We hypothesized that mindfulness would moderate this effect such that state and trait mindfulness would be associated with less motivated perception. We adapted the methods of Balcetis and Dunning (2006) in an online study (N=161). Results show that state and trait mindfulness predicted less motivated perception. These effects were stronger after excluding participants who noticed the ambiguity of the image as well as controlling for mood. These findings suggest that mindfulness is a stance of greater objectivity.},

abstract = {Although alternative methods have been proposed, mindfulness is predominantly measured by means of self-assessment instruments. Until now, several scales have been published and to some degree also psychometrically validated. The number of scales reflects the widespread research interest. While some authors have started to compare the underlying concepts and operationalizations of these scales, up to now no overview has been presented describing, contrasting, and evaluating the different methodological approaches towards measuring mindfulness including questionnaires and alternative approaches. In light of this, the present article summarizes the state of mindfulness measurement. Recommendations on how current measurement practice may be improved are provided, as well as recommendations as to what measurement instruments are deemed to be most appropriate for a particular research context. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Abstract
Objective To examine the temporal relation between depression and cognitive impairment in old age.
Design Prospective, population based study with four years of follow up.
Setting City of Leiden, the Netherlands.
Participants 500 people aged 85 years at recruitment.
Main outcome measures Annual assessments of depressive symptoms (15 item geriatric depression scale), global cognitive function (mini-mental state examination), attention (Stroop test), processing speed (letter digit coding test), and immediate and delayed recall (12 word learning test).
Results At 85 years old, participants&#039; depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment were highly significantly correlated (P &lt; 0.001). During follow up, an accelerated annual increase of depressive symptoms was associated with impaired attention (0.08 points (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.16)), immediate recall (0.17 points (0.09 to 0.25)), and delayed recall (0.10 points (0.02 to 0.18)) at baseline. In contrast, depressive symptoms at baseline were not related to an accelerated cognitive decline during follow up (P &gt; 0.05).
Conclusion Caregivers should be aware of the development of depressive symptoms when cognitive impairment is present. However, the presence of depression only does not increase the risk of cognitive decline.

abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach  conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
(ICF) and represents the typical spectrum of problems in the functioning
of patients with stroke. PURPOSE The objective of this study was
to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective of occupational
therapists. METHODS In a three-round electronic mail survey using
the Delphi technique, occupational therapists experienced in stroke
treatment were asked about patients'problems, patients' resources,
and aspects of environment they take care of. Two health professionals
linked responses to the ICF. FINDINGS Sixty-nine occupational therapists
in 21 countries named 1,747 concepts that occupational therapists
treat in patients with stroke. These concepts were linked to 347
different ICF categories. Twenty-three concepts were linked to the
ICF component Personal Factors. CONCLUSION The content validity of
the "ICF Core Set for stroke" was largely supported by occupational
therapists.},

abstract = {The use of mindfulness training for increasing psychological well-being
in a variety of clinical and nonclinical populations has exploded
over the last decade. In the area of stuttering, it has been widely
recognized that effective long-term management often necessitates
treatment of cognitive and affective dimensions of the disorder in
addition to behavioral components. Yet, mindfulness based strategies
and their possible usefulness in stuttering management have not been
described in detail in the literature. This article seeks to engage
professionals who treat stuttering in a conversation about the possible
usefulness of incorporating mindfulness training into stuttering
management. A review of the literature reveals that there is a substantial
overlap between what is required for effective stuttering management
and the benefits provided by mindfulness practices. Mindfulness practice
results in decreased avoidance, increased emotional regulation, and
acceptance in addition to improved sensory-perceptual processing
and attentional regulation skills. These skills are important for
successful long-term stuttering management on both psychosocial and
sensory-motor levels. It is concluded that the integration of mindfulness
training and stuttering treatment appears practical and worthy of
exploration. Mindfulness strategies adapted for people who stutter
may help in the management of cognitive, affective, and behavioral
challenges associated with stuttering. Educational objectives: Readers
should be able to: (1) describe what mindfulness is and how it is
cultivated; (2) identify the benefits that can be produced from mindfulness
practice; (3) summarize how the benefits of mindfulness practice
parallel what is often required for effective long-term stuttering
management; and (4) identify specific mindfulness techniques that
can be taught in stuttering therapy and explain their rationale.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify women's satisfaction with delivery care in informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya, and to determine characteristics of women and delivery care associated with satisfaction. DESIGN: Household survey data analysis of 1266 women who delivered in health facilities in 2004 or 2005. SETTING: Two densely populated informal settlements 7 and 12 km from Nairobi's center, where residents work primarily in the nearby industrial area or in the informal sector. Outcome Satisfaction was assessed by whether women would recommend the delivery care facility and deliver there again. RESULTS: Over half (56%) of women would both recommend and deliver again in the same facility. In multivariate analysis, women's satisfaction with delivery care was associated with greater provider empathy (OR = 3.68, 95% CI 2.27, 5.97). Women's satisfaction with delivery care was also associated with the pregnancy having been wanted (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.82, 4.14) or mistimed vs. unwanted. Women delivering at private facilities in the settlement near the industrial area were more satisfied than women delivering at private facilities in the more distant and marginalized settlement (OR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.45, 3.09). The association of women's satisfaction and provider empathy was stronger among women who experienced complications compared to those who did not. CONCLUSION: Health providers should be sensitized to the finding that unintended pregnancy is associated with lower satisfaction with delivery care. Maternal health programmes should focus on increasing provider empathy, especially for women who experience complications, in both private and government health facilities.},

abstract = {Families often draw their conclusions about the quality of care received by a family member during the last months of life from their interactions with professional caregivers. A more comprehensive understanding of how these relationships influence the care experience should include an investigation of the association between employee job satisfaction and family perception of the quality of care. This cross-sectional study investigated the association at a regional hospice. Using the Kendall's tau correlation, employee satisfaction scores for care teams trended toward a positive correlation with family overall satisfaction scores from the Family Evaluation of Hospice Care (tau=0.47, P=0.10). A trend for differences in employee satisfaction between the care teams to associate with differences in overall family perceptions of the quality of care also was found using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (chi(2)(K-W)=9.236, P=0.075). Post hoc tests indicated that overall family perceptions of quality of care differed between the hospice's Residence Team and Non-Hospice Facilities Team. Finally, positive associations between employee satisfaction and the families' Intent to recommend hospice (tau=0.55, P=0.059) and Inform and communicate about patient (tau=0.55, P=0.059) were noted. Selected employee and family comments provide complementarity to further clarify or explain the respondent data. These results suggest that employee satisfaction is associated with family perceptions of the quality of hospice care. Opportunities for improving both employee job satisfaction and family perceptions of the quality of care are discussed.},

The first academic articles on computer anxiety were published in the early 1980s. Since that time, hundreds of papers have been published on the topic. Yet, up to this time, no one has done a comprehensive review of computer anxiety. In this article, 276 articles on computer anxiety are reviewed. From a synthesis of the articles and variables studied to date, a framework is developed that outlines the primary topics studied in computer anxiety literature. Nine antecedents, five correlates, and two outcomes of computer anxiety are identified as the most studied variables in the literature. In addition, a statistical comparison is done to compare the distribution of computer anxiety topics and results published in the 1990s to those published in the 2000s.

abstract = {\n\nThis study analyzed the dimensionality of the German version of Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale (RSES) in a nationally representative population sample of 4,988 subjects (46.4% males; aged 14–92 years). Using confirmatory factor analysis, one- and two-dimensional models were tested. Results suggest that the RSES is a two-dimensional scale comprising the highly correlated components positive and negative self-evaluation, which constitute a unitary construct of global self-esteem at the second-order level. In order to obtain a more conclusive solution, an item response theory (IRT) analysis (partial credit model) was conducted. Results lend support to a one-dimensional view of the RSES. Furthermore, psychometric properties and norm values based on the representative sample are reported. Analyses revealed extremely high response probabilities for all items, as a consequence of which self-esteem cannot be differentiated at the upper end of the range.\n},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The underlying changes in biological processes that are
associated with reported changes in mental and physical health in
response to meditation have not been systematically explored. We
performed a randomized, controlled study on the effects on brain
and immune function of a well-known and widely used 8-week clinical
training program in mindfulness meditation applied in a work environment
with healthy employees. METHODS: We measured brain electrical activity
before and immediately after, and then 4 months after an 8-week training
program in mindfulness meditation. Twenty-five subjects were tested
in the meditation group. A wait-list control group (N = 16) was tested
at the same points in time as the meditators. At the end of the 8-week
period, subjects in both groups were vaccinated with influenza vaccine.
RESULTS: We report for the first time significant increases in left-sided
anterior activation, a pattern previously associated with positive
affect, in the meditators compared with the nonmeditators. We also
found significant increases in antibody titers to influenza vaccine
among subjects in the meditation compared with those in the wait-list
control group. Finally, the magnitude of increase in left-sided activation
predicted the magnitude of antibody titer rise to the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS:
These findings demonstrate that a short program in mindfulness meditation
produces demonstrable effects on brain and immune function. These
findings suggest that meditation may change brain and immune function
in positive ways and underscore the need for additional research.},

The results showed that the original 17-item HDS was without adequate
consistency, i.e. the total score of the sample of items was no one-dimensional
measure of depressive states. However, a melancholia subscale of
the HDS contained items the total of which can be used to compare
patients quantitatively, although in some part of the analysis one
of these items showed ceiling effect. It was concluded that the melancholia
sub-scale (containing the items depressed mood, guilt, work and interests,
retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms) can form
the basis for further improvements in the field of quantitative rating
scales for depressive states.},

Method.Questionnaires which are published in peer-reviewed journals and listed in Pubmed or PsycInfo were included. The questionnaires were analysed and, using a content-analytical approach, the respective items were categorised and linked to the ICF. Results.Ten questionnaires were included. Ninety-four per cent (N=341) of the concepts could be linked to 37 different ICF categories. One hundred and seventy-one (50.1%) concepts were linked to ICF categories of the component Body Function, 74 (21.7%) to categories of the component Activity and Participation and none to categories of the component Environmental Factors. In total, 28.2% of the linked concepts belonged to Personal factors, which are not yet classified in the ICF. The questionnaires exhibited considerable differences regarding content density (i.e. The average number of concepts per item) and content diversity (i.e. The number of ICF categories per concept). Conclusions.The ICF provides an useful external reference to identify and compare the concepts contained in mindfulness questionnaires. Also, mindfulness questionnaire concepts suggest potentially useful factors for classification within the ICF. {\textcopyright} 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

@article{Grossman2004a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR.

METHODS: Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis.

RESULTS: Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P<.0001) with homogeneity of distribution.

CONCLUSION: Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.},

Open scientific practices such as sharing data, materials and analysis scripts alongside published articles have many benefits, including easier replication and extension studies, increased availability of data for theory-building and meta- analysis, and increased possibility of review and collaboration even after a paper has been published. Although modern information technology makes sharing easier than ever before, uptake of open practices had been slow. We suggest this might be in part due to a social dilemma arising from misaligned incentives and propose a specific, concrete mechanism—reviewers withholding comprehensive review—to achieve the goal of creating the expectation of open practices as a matter of scientific principle.},

abstract = {The therapeutic process involves many different types of affective phenomena. No single therapeutic perspective has been able to encompass within its own theoretical framework all the ways in which emotion plays a role in therapeutic change. A comprehensive, constructive theory of emotion helps transcend the differences in the therapeutic schools by viewing emotion as a complex synthesis of expressive motor, schematic, and conceptual information that provides organisms with information about their responses to situations that helps them orient adaptively in the environment. In addition to improved theory, increased precision in the assessment of affective functioning in therapy, as well as greater specification of different emotional change processes and means of facilitating these, will allow the role of emotion in change to be studied more effectively. A number of different change processes involving emotion are discussed, as well as principles of emotionally focused intervention that help access emotion and promote emotional restructuring.},

The pontine tegmentum also holds the region where cholinergic stimulation can trigger all the behavioural and bioelectric signs of REM sleep. The exact location has been investigated and amply discussed over the last few years. Studies in the authors> laboratory, mapping the pontine tegmentum with small volume carbachol (a cholinergic agonist) microinjections, have demonstrated that the executive neurons for REM sleep generation are neither located in the dorsal part of the pontine tegmentum, nor diffusely spread through the medial pontine reticular formation: they are concentrated in a discrete area in the ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (vRPO). In turn, the vRPO has connections with structures involved in the generation of the other states of the sleep-wake cycle as well as with structures responsible for the generation of each of the different events characterizing REM sleep. This allows us to propose the vRPO as the crucial region for REM sleep generation. Related research, with invivo and invitro experiments, into the actions of different neurotransmitters on vRPO neurones indicates that not only acetylcholine but other neurotransmitters have an active key role in vRPO REM sleep generation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The inference from order to quantity is fundamental to psychometrics because the sorts of attributes that psychometricians aspire to measure are experienced directly only as ordered and, yet, it is concluded that such attributes are measurable on interval scales (i.e., that they are quantitative). This inference has been a feature of psychometrics since early last century, before which it permeated scientific thought and played a role in the development of psychophysics. Despite this, its cogency has been analysed only rarely. Elsewhere, I have argued that it is not deductively valid, a point that might be considered obvious except that attempts have been made to show otherwise. Its invalidity displayed, it is easily shown that it is not inductively reasonable either. However, it might still be urged that the inference from order to quantity is an inference to the best explanation: that is, that quantitative structure is reasonably abduced from order. I argue that the opposite is true: the most plausible hypothesis is that the sorts of attributes psychometricians aspire to measure are merely ordinal attributes with impure differences of degree, a feature logically incompatible with quantitative structure. If so, psychometrics is built upon a myth.},

abstract = {Many collective human activities, including violence, have been shown to exhibit universal patterns. The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions. However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency, is robust to many generalizations, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism and ecology. Its similarity to financial market models provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.},

This article will inform the reader of the meaning and interpretation of these two statistical concepts. METHODS: The uses of these two statistical concepts and the differences between them are discussed on the basis of a selective literature search concerning the methods employed in scientific articles. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: P-values in scientific studies are used to determine whether a null hypothesis formulated before the performance of the study is to be accepted or rejected. In exploratory studies, p-values enable the recognition of any statistically noteworthy findings. Confidence intervals provide information about a range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of probability, as well as about the direction and strength of the demonstrated effect. This enables conclusions to be drawn about the statistical plausibility and clinical relevance of the study findings. It is often useful for both statistical measures to be reported in scientific articles, because they provide complementary types of information.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In  mice , the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended.  mice  adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix.  mice  can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

Main outcome measure Psychometric properties of both the 15-item (complete) and 3-item (shortened) versions of the CTM in Hebrew and Arabic. Reliability established using internal consistency with Cronbach's-alpha. Exploratory factor analysis conducted using Varimax rotation. Convergent validity determined with Pearson correlation and ANOVA tests.\n\nRESULTS: Three hundred and eighteen Hebrew- and Arabic-speaking oncology patients completed the questionnaire. Cronbach's-alpha for the questionnaire was 0.94 and 0.90 for the Hebrew and the Arabic versions, respectively. Factor analysis resulted in three factors in each of the translated versions with a cumulative variance of 73.41% and 69.2% in the Hebrew and Arabic versions, respectively. Tests of the convergent validity showed that the measure is correlated with health status and that the shortened and complete versions' ratings are consistent across different patient groups.\n\nCONCLUSION: The translated Hebrew and Arabic versions of the questionnaire are reliable and valid instruments to assess patients' transitions across settings in diverse populations.},

Participants (N = 112) were divided into four groups (n = 28). They either exclusively studied 36 action phrases (e.g., "lift the glass") or both studied and cued-recalled them in four trials. During study trials participants encoded the action phrases either by motorically performing them, or by reading them aloud, and they took final verb-cued recall tests over 18-min and 1-week retention intervals. A testing effect was demonstrated for action phrases, however, only when they were verbally encoded, and not when they were enacted. Similarly, enactive (relative to verbal) encoding reduced the rate of forgetting, but only when the action phrases were exclusively studied, and not when they were also tested. These less-than-additive effects of enactment and testing on the rate of forgetting, as well as on long-term retention, support the notion that both study techniques effectively promote item-specific processing that can only be marginally increased further by combining them.},

@book{Mahajan2010,
abstract = {In problem solving, as in street fighting, rules are for fools: do whatever works—don't just stand there! Yet we often fear an unjustified leap even though it may land us on a correct result. Traditional mathematics teaching is largely about solving exactly stated problems exactly, yet life often hands us partly defined problems needing only moderately accurate solutions. This engaging book is an antidote to the rigor mortis brought on by too much mathematical rigor, teaching us how to guess answers without needing a proof or an exact calculation. In Street-Fighting Mathematics, Sanjoy Mahajan builds, sharpens, and demonstrates tools for educated guessing and down-and-dirty, opportunistic problem solving across diverse fields of knowledge—from mathematics to management. Mahajan describes six tools: dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, picture proofs, successive approximation, and reasoning by analogy. Illustrating each tool with numerous examples, he carefully separates the tool—the general principle—from the particular application so that the reader can most easily grasp the tool itself to use on problems of particular interest. Street-Fighting Mathematics grew out of a short course taught by the author at MIT for students ranging from first-year undergraduates to graduate students ready for careers in physics, mathematics, management, electrical engineering, computer science, and biology. They benefited from an approach that avoided rigor and taught them how to use mathematics to solve real problems. Street-Fighting Mathematics is available in print and online under a Creative Commons Noncommercial Share Alike license. About the Author Sanjoy Mahajan studied mathematics at the University of Oxford and received a PhD in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology. He is now Associate Director of the Teaching and Learning Laboratory and a Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Before coming to MIT, he was a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and a Lecturer in Physics in the University of Cambridge.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence on time perception of pictures showing liked or disliked foods in comparison with a neutral picture. Healthy adults performed a temporal bisection task in which they had to categorize the presentation duration of pictures (neutral, liked, and disliked foods) as more similar to a short (400 ms) or to a long (1,600 ms) standard duration. The data revealed that the presentation duration of food pictures was underestimated compared with the presentation duration of the neutral picture, and that this underestimation was more marked for the disliked than for the liked food pictures. These results are consistent with the idea that this time underestimation arises from an attentional-bias mechanism. The food pictures, and particularly those depicting disliked food items, distracted attention away from the processing of time.},

@article{Vuori1991,
abstract = {The paper aims at answering the question: Has the measurement of patient satisfaction improved the quality of care? After concluding that there is no evidence in the literature, the paper proceeds to look at why the evidence is lacking. Four factors seem to explain it: the objectives, the focus and the originator of the patients satisfaction studies and measurements and difficulties related to the interpretation of the findings. The last part of the paper analyses why patient satisfaction should be taken seriously although we do not know whether its measurement improves the quality of care. They include the fact that the patients are partners in health care; they literally feel in their skin whether care is good or bad. They are also the best judges of certain aspects of care, such as amenities and interpersonal relations. The second reason is the transformation of health care from a sellers market to a consumers' market where the satisfaction of the patients needs is part of the definition of quality. Finally, there is the ideological reason that, in a democratic society, the patients should have the right to influence decisions and activities influencing them. Measurement of patient satisfaction realizes the principle of community participation in health care.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review and synthesize the state of research on a variety of meditation practices, including: the specific meditation practices examined; the research designs employed and the conditions and outcomes examined; the efficacy and effectiveness of different meditation practices for the three most studied conditions; the role of effect modifiers on outcomes; and the effects of meditation on physiological and neuropsychological outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Comprehensive searches were conducted in 17 electronic databases of medical and psychological literature up to September 2005. Other sources of potentially relevant studies included hand searches, reference tracking, contact with experts, and gray literature searches. REVIEW METHODS: A Delphi method was used to develop a set of parameters to describe meditation practices. Included studies were comparative, on any meditation practice, had more than 10 adult participants, provided quantitative data on health-related outcomes, and published in English. Two independent reviewers assessed study relevance, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Five broad categories of meditation practices were identified (Mantra meditation, Mindfulness meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong). Characterization of the universal or supplemental components of meditation practices was precluded by the theoretical and terminological heterogeneity among practices. Evidence on the state of research in meditation practices was provided in 813 predominantly poor-quality studies. The three most studied conditions were hypertension, other cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse. Sixty-five intervention studies examined the therapeutic effect of meditation practices for these conditions. Meta-analyses based on low-quality studies and small numbers of hypertensive participants showed that TM(R), Qi Gong and Zen Buddhist meditation significantly reduced blood pressure. Yoga helped reduce stress. Yoga was no better than Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction at reducing anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases. No results from substance abuse studies could be combined. The role of effect modifiers in meditation practices has been neglected in the scientific literature. The physiological and neuropsychological effects of meditation practices have been evaluated in 312 poor-quality studies. Meta-analyses of results from 55 studies indicated that some meditation practices produced significant changes in healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: Many uncertainties surround the practice of meditation. Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable and valid questionnaire to evaluate satisfaction with maternity care in Sylheti-speaking Bangladeshi women.\n\nDESIGN: Two-stage, psychometric study. Firstly, focus groups, in-depth interviews and iterative methods for translation and cultural adaptation were used to develop a Sylheti questionnaire, called the survey of Bangladeshi women's experience of maternity services from an English language questionnaire. Secondly, quantitative psychometric methods were used to field test and evaluate the acceptability, reliability and validity of this questionnaire.\n\nSETTING: Four hospitals providing maternity services in London, UK.\n\nSTUDY PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and forty-two women from the London Bangladeshi communities, who were in the antenatal (at least 4 months pregnant) or postnatal phase (up to 6 months after delivery). Women spoke Sylheti; a language with no accepted written form. Two purposive samples of 40 women in the antenatal or postnatal phase, one convenience sample of six women in the antenatal phase and three consecutve samples of 60 women in the postnatal phase participated in stage one. In stage two, 135 women (main sample) completed the questionnaire two months after delivery (82% response rate); 50 women (retest sample) from the main sample completed a second questionnaire two weeks later (96% response rate).\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's views about maternity care elicited by qualitative methods and measured quantitatively using the survey of Bangladeshi women's experience of maternity services.\n\nRESULTS: The 121-item questionnaire was acceptable to women and showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas 0.76-0.91), stability (test-retest reliability 0.72-0.84) and construct validity (e.g. able to detect group differences).\n\nCONCLUSION: By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, it is possible to adapt an instrument to provide an acceptable, reliable and valid Sylheti questionnaire. The approach taken in developing this questonnaire provides a model for developing outcome measures for use with other minority ethnic communities.},

abstract = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, "cooking" of data, etc... Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97% (N = 7, 95%CI: 0.86-4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once--a serious form of misconduct by any standard--and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% (N = 12, 95% CI: 9.91-19.72) for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words "falsification" or "fabrication", and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

abstract = {The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005) is designed to measure the tendency to override a prepotent response alternative that is incorrect and to engage in further reflection that leads to the correct response. It is a prime measure of the miserly information processing posited by most dual process theories. The original three-item test may be becoming known to potential participants, however. We examined a four-item version that could serve as a substitute for the original. Our data show that it displays a .58 correlation with the original version and that it has very similar relationships with cognitive ability, various thinking dispositions, and with several other rational thinking tasks. Combining the two versions into a seven-item test resulted in a measure of miserly processing with substantial reliability (.72). The seven-item version was a strong independent predictor of performance on rational thinking tasks after the variance accounted for by cognitive ability and thinking dispositions had been partialled out.

abstract = {While much attention has been devoted to examining the beneficial effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs on patients' ability to cope with various chronic medical conditions, most studies have relied on self-report measures of improvement. Given that these measures may not accurately reflect physiological conditions, there is a need for an objective marker of improvement in research evaluating the beneficial effects of stress management programs. Cortisol is the major stress hormone in the human organism and as such is a promising candidate measure in the study of the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs. In conjunction with other biological measures, the use of cortisol levels as a physiological marker of stress may be useful to validate self-reported benefits attributed to this program. In the current manuscript, we review the available literature on the role of cortisol as a physiological marker for improvement with regards to mindfulness practice, and make recommendations for future study designs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In three experiments, we investigated the spontaneous attention of perceivers to the nature of targets' facial expressions, specifically whether they were displaying an enjoyment or a non-enjoyment smile. Further, we investigated the social functions of sensitivity to smile type and the consequences of such sensitivity for subsequent interactions. Results demonstrated that perceivers did indeed spontaneously attend to smile type, especially in situations where issues of trust or cooperation were made salient. Further, this sensitivity had an impact both on the evaluations of the target individuals and the cooperative behaviour of individuals towards those displaying enjoyment and non-enjoyment smiles. Participants evaluated individuals displaying enjoyment smiles more positively than those displaying non-enjoyment smiles and had higher rates of cooperation with those displaying enjoyment smiles. These results are discussed in terms of the social functions of facial expressions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Interest in mindfulness-based interventions for children and adolescents is burgeoning, bringing with it the need for validated instruments to assess mindfulness in youths. The present studies were designed to validate among adolescents a measure of mindfulness previously validated for adults (e.g., Brown & Ryan, 2003), which we herein call the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A). In 2 large samples of healthy 14- to 18-year-olds (N = 595), Study 1 supported a single-factor MAAS-A structure, along with acceptably high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and both concurrent and incremental validity. In Study 2, with a sample of 102 psychiatric outpatient adolescents age 14-18 years, participants randomized to a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention showed significant increases in MAAS-A scores from baseline to 3-month follow-up, relative to nonsignificant score changes among treatment-as-usual participants. Increases in MAAS-A scores among mindfulness-based stress reduction participants were significantly related to beneficial changes in numerous mental health indicators. The findings support the reliability and validity of the MAAS-A in normative and mixed psychiatric adolescent populations and suggest that the MAAS-A has utility in mindfulness intervention research.},

abstract = {In this research we claim that teachers' enthusiasm matters regarding student engagement in terms of academic cheating. Previous studies found that perceived enthusiasm of teachers is positively related to the intrinsic motivation of the students. However, it was less investigated how perceived enthusiasm is related to cheating. In the first exploratory questionnaire study (N = 244) we found that during the exams of those teachers who are perceived to be enthusiastic students tend to cheat less. In the second questionnaire study (N = 266) we took academic motivations into consideration and we found that the more teachers seem enthusiastic the cheating rate will be lower among university students. Aggregated teacher enthusiasm was positively related to intrinsic motivation, negatively related to amotivation, and not related to extrinsic motivation. Aggregated teacher enthusiasm was directly and negatively linked to cheating and it explained more variance in cheating than academic motivations together. These results suggest that teachers' perceived enthusiasm can be a yet unexplored interpersonal factor which could effectively prevent academic cheating.},

The 2nd main task is to apply an analysis of appraisal patterns and the core relational themes that they produce to a number of commonly identified emotions. Anger, anxiety, sadness, and pride (to include 1 positive emotion) are used as illustrations. The purpose is to show the capability of a cognitive-motivational-relational theory to explain and predict the emotions.

@article{Gradinger2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) provides a comprehensive and universally
accepted framework to classify changes in functioning related to
health conditions. Comprehensive and Brief Core Sets have been defined
for various disorders but not for sleep disorders. Such a Core Set
would greatly enhance the techniques available to describe the impact
of sleep disorders on patients. The overarching purpose of this paper
is to report on phase 1 of the international and World Health Organization
(WHO) endorsed consensus process in identifying ICF Core Sets for
sleep disorders. METHODS A formal decision-making and consensus process
which integrated evidence gathered from preparatory studies was carried
out. Relevant ICF categories were selected by a sample of international
experts from different backgrounds using the nominal group technique.
RESULTS Twenty-six experts from 22 countries and different professional
backgrounds attended the consensus conference. Altogether 120 second-
or third-level ICF categories were included in the Comprehensive
ICF Core Set with the following ICF component split: 49 categories
from body functions, 8 from body structures, 31 from activities and
participation and 32 from environmental factors. The Brief ICF Core
Set included a total of 15 second-level categories: 5 body functions
(sleep, energy and drive, attention, consciousness, respiration functions);
3 body structures (brain, respiratory system, pharynx); 4 activities
and participation (focusing attention, driving, handling stress and
other psychological demands, carrying out daily routine); and 3 environmental
factors (immediate family; health services, systems, and policies;
and health professionals). CONCLUSION A formal consensus process
integrating evidence and expert opinion led to the first version
of the ICF Core Sets for persons with sleep disorders. Further validation
of the Core Set is needed.},

Electroencephalographic measures indicate an overall slowing subsequent to meditation, with theta and alpha activation related to proficiency of practice. Sensory evoked potential assessment of concentrative meditation yields amplitude and latency changes for some components and practices. Cognitive event-related potential evaluation of meditation implies that practice changes attentional allocation. Neuroimaging studies indicate increased regional cerebral blood flow measures during meditation. Taken together, meditation appears to reflect changes in anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal areas. Neurophysiological meditative state and trait effects are variable but are beginning to demonstrate consistent outcomes for research and clinical applications. Psychological and clinical effects of meditation are summarized, integrated, and discussed with respect to neuroimaging data.},

This article describes the study component that measures patients' views of the quality of care. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument, to determine the predictors of patients' ratings of quality and to measure patient satisfaction at two points in time to determine whether patient ratings change following a quality improvement initiative. The instrument developed in this study was designed to assess patients' perceptions of the quality of hospital services, staff work environment and overall satisfaction for the purpose of providing feedback to hospital staff. This information would be used for quality improvement efforts within the hospital. Unique to this instrument are questions regarding patients' perceptions of the hospital staff work environment. The results revealed that the questionnaire demonstrated valid and reliable properties. The significant predictors of quality ratings were information concerning one's illness, and perceptions of the staff work environment. Patient satisfaction was measured and then reassessed following the implementation of various department-based improvement programs. The reassessment revealed significantly higher patient ratings in most areas. An intrinsic aspect of this quality program was the engagement of, and feedback process to, hospital personnel. Questionnaire results were reported graphically to hospital management and staff, thus serving as a catalyst for improvement.},

We analyzed the expression profiles of HCC samples without or with intra-hepatic metastases. Using a supervised machine-learning algorithm, we generated for the first time a molecular signature that can classify metastatic HCC patients and identified genes that were relevant to metastasis and patient survival. We found that the gene expression signature of primary HCCs with accompanying metastasis was very similar to that of their corresponding metastases, implying that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. Osteopontin, which was identified as a lead gene in the signature, was over-expressed in metastatic HCC; an osteopontin-specific antibody effectively blocked HCC cell invasion in vitro and inhibited pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells in nude mice. Thus, osteopontin acts as both a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for metastatic HCC.},

the comprehensive International Classification of Functioning, Disability
and Health (ICF) Core Sets, and (ii) develop brief ICF Core Sets
from the ICF Categories of these more comprehensive ICF Core Sets.
Design: Prospective multi-centre cohort study. Patients: Patients
receiving rehabilitation interventions for musculoskeletal, neurological
or cardiopulmonary injury or disease in acute hospitals or early
post-acute rehabilitation facilities. Methods: Functioning was coded
using the ICF. For validation, absolute and relative frequencies
(prevalences) of impairment, limitation or restriction were reported
at admission and end-point (discharge or 6 weeks after admission).
Aspects not covered were extracted and translated into the best corresponding
ICF category. The criterion for selecting candidate categories for
the brief ICF Core Sets was based on their ability to discriminate
between patients with high or low functioning status. Discrimination
was assessed using multivariable regression models, the independent
variables being all of the ICF categories of the respective comprehensive
ICF Core Set. Analogue ratings of overall functioning as reported
by patients and health professionals were used as dependent variables.
Conclusion: We present an algorithm to identify candidate categories
for brief ICF Core Sets extracted from the comprehensive acute and
post-acute ICF Core Sets.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To examine the completeness and validity of the terms used
in ENP in describing nursing diagnoses using a cross-mapping to ICNP.
METHODS The mapping procedure was carried out using the parallel
mapping method. RESULTS The interrater reliability showed good to
very good results. The percentage of agreement of the rating results
for the ICNP phenomenon axes was between 73% and 99%, and the randomly
adjusted Cohen's Kappa value was 0.88 on the ICNP focus axis. DISCUSSION
The results of the mapping show that both classifications, ENP and
INCP, are not yet complete for illustrating all aspects of nursing.
Both classifications use a large proportion of overlapping terms
(75%), and a small proportion of terms (25%) which describe different
dimensions of nursing in both ENP and ICNP. CONCLUSION The results
of the mapping are discussed in consideration of the nurse's perspective.
The main focus is on the difference between pre-combined systems,
like ENP, and post-combined, like ICNP, and their implications on
the use of nursing classifications in practice for the illustration
of the nursing process.},

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCI often prefer SPC than other methods offered to them, because of quality-of-life issues. The incidence of significant complications might not be as high as previously reported, and with a commitment to careful follow-up, SPC can be a safe option for carefully selected patients if adequate surveillance can be ensured.},

abstract = {Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals ("journal rank") that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.},

abstract = {Mindfulness involves nonjudgmental attention to present-moment experience. In its therapeutic forms, mindfulness interventions promote increased tolerance of negative affect and improved well-being. However, the neural mechanisms underlying mindful mood regulation are poorly understood. Mindfulness training appears to enhance focused attention, supported by the anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In emotion regulation, these PFC changes promote the stable recruitment of a nonconceptual sensory pathway, an alternative to conventional attempts to cognitively reappraise negative emotion. In neural terms, the transition to nonconceptual awareness involves reducing evaluative processing, supported by midline structures of the PFC. Instead, attentional resources are directed toward a limbic pathway for present-moment sensory awareness, involving the thalamus, insula, and primary sensory regions. In patients with affective disorders, mindfulness training provides an alternative to cognitive efforts to control negative emotion, instead directing attention toward the transitory nature of momentary experience. Limiting cognitive elaboration in favour of momentary awareness appears to reduce automatic negative self-evaluation, increase tolerance for negative affect and pain, and help to engender self-compassion and empathy in people with chronic dysphoria.},

abstract = {(from the cover) This third edition of "Influence: Science and Practice" provides a thorough, up-to-date exploration of the psychology of compliance and persuasion. Evidence from the diverse, yet completely relevant arenas of controlled research and the working world of influence professionals is examined in light of six basic (and very powerful) principles of psychology that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. The ideal supplement for students of psychology, management, sales, marketing, and persuasion, and a fascinating read for anyone interested in the power and tactics of influence, this text demonstrates how influence affects our daily lives and offers "defense" sections that show how to resist undue influence.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of large clinical datasets to assess the effectiveness
of health care is of growing interest in continuing efforts to understand
the impact of healthcare costs on quality. Correspondingly, there
is a greater need to define and measure outcomes that are sensitive
to nursing interventions. However, concerns exist about the ability
to amass and use large clinical nursing datasets to assess the effectiveness
of nursing interventions. Some nursing studies have used large clinical
datasets to examine patterns of nursing diagnoses, interventions,
and outcomes. Among patient populations, however, systematic effectiveness
studies of nursing process and outcome linkages at the individual
nurse and patient level of analysis are essentially nonexistent.
This is largely the result of slow development of nursing classifications,
reference terminologies, and reference information standards. Nursing
information systems have an unprecedented potential for documentation
of nursing practice, as well as the accumulation and analysis of
large clinical datasets, to improve nursing performance, increase
nursing knowledge, and provide data and information necessary for
nursing to participate in the formulation of healthcare policy. OBJECTIVES:
A literature search shows that a common framework is beginning to
evolve that represents nursing's essential information, eg, the Nursing
Minimum Data Set, Management Minimum Data Set, and several standardized
nursing languages. Extensive research and other initiatives have
produced 1) nursing languages and reference terminologies that span
healthcare settings; 2) information models; and 3) standards for
datasets supporting information systems. A number of issues remain,
however, that concern the development of uniform nursing datasets,
definitions of outcomes, quality of nursing data, information system
design, and methods of data analysis. We review nursing process outcome
research, clarify issues inherent in nursing effectiveness research,
and discuss implications for nursing and health policy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Review of the literature reveals a need to develop a questionnaire that measures patient perceptions of factors impacting continuity of care following discharge from hospital. Such a measure has the potential to guide quality improvement initiatives related to continuity of care. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a measure that would meet this need, the Patient Continuity of Care Questionnaire (PCCQ). METHOD: The PCCQ was administered to 204 inpatients 4 weeks after discharge. The questionnaire was assessed by item and principal components analysis. Factors derived from principal components analysis were assessed for internal consistency and construct validity. RESULTS: A principal components analysis resulted in six subscales including perceptions of: (1) relationships with providers in hospital, (2) information transfer to patients, (3) relationships with providers in community, (4) management of written forms, (5) management of follow-up and (6) management of communication among providers. These subscales were internally consistent in our sample and demonstrated construct validity through correlations with other related constructs. CONCLUSION: This initial study supports the reliability and validity of the PCCQ for measuring patient perceptions of factors central to continuity of care. The questionnaire subscales correspond to the theoretical components of continuity of care that have been proposed in the literature, namely informational, relational and management continuity. The subscales may be of value for identifying problems in continuity of care and for evaluating interventions aimed at improving continuity of care for patients after hospital discharge.},

An optimal 8-member MAP agreed with expert diagnosis for 90 control subjects (95%), 36 patients with probable AD (75%), and 38 patients with probable PD (95%). This MAP consisted of the following (in decreasing order of contribution): tau, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 8, Abeta42, beta2-microglobulin, vitamin D binding protein, apolipoprotein (apo) AII, and apoE. This first large-scale validation of a proteomic-discovered MAP suggests a panel of 8 CSF proteins that are highly effective at identifying PD and moderately effective at identifying AD.},

abstract = {With a rapidly aging society it becomes increasingly important to counter normal age-related decline in cognitive functioning. Growing evidence suggests that cognitive training programs may have the potential to counteract this decline. On the basis of a growing body of research that shows that meditation has positive effects on cognition in younger and middle-aged adults, meditation may be able to offset normal age-related cognitive decline or even enhance cognitive function in older adults. In this paper, we review studies investigating the effects of meditation on age-related cognitive decline. We searched the Web of Science (1900 to present), PsycINFO (1597 to present), MEDLINE (1950 to present), and CABI (1910 to present) to identify original studies investigating the effects of meditation on cognition and cognitive decline in the context of aging. Twelve studies were included in the review, six of which were randomized controlled trials. Studies involved a wide variety of meditation techniques and reported preliminary positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed, and general cognition. However, most studies had a high risk of bias and small sample sizes. Reported dropout rates were low and compliance rates high. We conclude that meditation interventions for older adults are feasible, and preliminary evidence suggests that meditation can offset age-related cognitive decline.},

At present, however, there are no validated UK scales available specifically addressed to nursing. The aim of the present study was to develop a sensitive, valid and reliable measure of patient satisfaction. This paper describes the first phase of the study, the development of a multidimensional concept of satisfaction from the patients' perspective. Using qualitative methods, patients were interviewed both in hospital and following discharge. Eleven main concepts were identified: nurses' manner, attentiveness, availability, reassurance, individual treatment, openness/informality, information, professionalism, ward organization, nurses' knowledge and ward environment. Beginning with customer-defined values has provided the starting point for the development of a scale to measure patients' satisfaction with nursing using concepts important to patients, rather than hospital personnel or research teams.},

Several classes of contamination were found, including tail weights from the uniform to the double exponential, exponential-level asymmetry, severe digit preferences, multimodalities, and modes external to the mean/median interval. Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data. However, findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions. A reevaluation of the statistical robustness literature appears appropriate in light of these findings.},

abstract = {Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in the present moment. We investigate the hypothesis that mindfulness training may alter or enhance specific aspects of attention. We examined three functionally and neuroanatomically distinct but overlapping attentional subsystems: alerting, orienting, and conflict monitoring. Functioning of each subsystem was indexed by performance on the Attention Network Test. Two types of mindfulness training (MT) programs were examined, and behavioral testing was conducted on participants before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) training. One training group consisted of individuals naive to mindfulness techniques who participated in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course that emphasized the development of concentrative meditation skills. The other training group consisted of individuals experienced in concentrative meditation techniques who participated in a 1-month intensive mindfulness retreat. Performance of these groups was compared with that of control participants who were meditation naive and received no MT. At Time 1, the participants in the retreat group demonstrated improved conflict monitoring performance relative to those in the MBSR and control groups. At Time 2, the participants in the MBSR course demonstrated significantly improved orienting in comparison with the control and retreat participants. In contrast, the participants in the retreat group demonstrated altered performance on the alerting component, with improvements in exogenous stimulus detection in comparison with the control and MBSR participants. The groups did not differ in conflict monitoring performance at Time 2. These results suggest that mindfulness training may improve attention-related behavioral responses by enhancing functioning of specific subcomponents of attention. Whereas participation in the MBSR course improved the ability to endogenously orient attention, retreat participation appeared to allow for the development and emergence of receptive attentional skills, which improved exogenous alerting-related process.},

It is written from the perspective that recent years have seen a remarkable development of knowledge about sleep mechanisms, due to the capability of current cellular neurophysiological, pharmacological and molecular techniques to provide focused, detailed, and replicable studies that have enriched and informed the knowledge of sleep phenomenology and pathology derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. This chapter has a cellular and neurophysiological/neuropharmacological focus, with an emphasis on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep mechanisms and non-REM (NREM) sleep phenomena attributable to adenosine. The survey of neuronal and neurotransmitter-related brainstem mechanisms of REM includes monoamines, acetylcholine, the reticular formation, a new emphasis on GABAergic mechanisms and a discussion of the role of orexin/hypcretin in diurnal consolidation of REM sleep. The focus of the NREM sleep discussion is on the basal forebrain and adenosine as a mediator of homeostatic control. Control is through basal forebrain extracellular adenosine accumulation during wakefulness and inhibition of wakefulness-active neurons. Over longer periods of sleep loss, there is a second mechanism of homeostatic control through transcriptional modification. Adenosine acting at the A1 receptor produces an up-regulation of A1 receptors, which increases inhibition for a given level of adenosine, effectively increasing the gain of the sleep homeostat. This second mechanism likely occurs in widespread cortical areas as well as in the basal forebrain. Finally, the results of a new series of experimental paradigms in rodents to measure the neurocognitive effects of sleep loss and sleep interruption (modeling sleep apnea) provide animal model data congruent with those in humans.},

abstract = {Representational measurement theory is the dominant theory of measurement within the philosophy of science; and the area in which the theory of conjoint measurement was developed. For many years it has been argued the Rasch model is conjoint measurement by several psychometricians. This paper critiques this argument from the perspective of representational measurement theory. It concludes that the Rasch model is not conjoint measurement as the model does not demonstrate the existence of a representation theorem between an empirical relational structure and a numerical relational structure. Psychologists seriously interested in investigating traits for quantitative structure should use the theory of conjoint measurement itself rather than the Rasch model. This is not to say, however, that empirical relationships between conjoint measurement and the Rasch model are precluded. The paper concludes by suggesting some relevant research avenues.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure patients' perceptions of patient centredness and the relation of these perceptions to outcomes.\n\nDESIGN: Observational study using questionnaires.\n\nSETTING: Three general practices.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: 865 consecutive patients attending the practices.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' enablement, satisfaction, and burden of symptoms.\n\nRESULTS: Factor analysis identified five components. These were communication and partnership (a sympathetic doctor interested in patients' worries and expectations and who discusses and agrees the problem and treatment, Cronbach's alpha=0.96); personal relationship (a doctor who knows the patient and their emotional needs, alpha=0.89); health promotion (alpha=0.87); positive approach (being definite about the problem and when it would settle, alpha=0.84); and interest in effect on patient's life (alpha=0.89). Satisfaction was related to communication and partnership (adjusted beta=19.1; 95% confidence interval 17.7 to 20.7) and a positive approach (4.28; 2.96 to 5.60). Enablement was greater with interest in the effect on life (0.55; 0.25 to 0.86), health promotion (0.57; 0.30 to 0.85), and a positive approach (0.82; 0.52 to 1.11). A positive approach was also associated with reduced symptom burden at one month (beta=-0.25; -0.41 to -0.10). Referrals were fewer if patients felt they had a personal relationship with their doctor (odds ratio 0.70; 0.54 to 0.90).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Components of patients' perceptions can be measured reliably and predict different outcomes. If doctors don't provide a positive, patient centred approach patients will be less satisfied, less enabled, and may have greater symptom burden and higher rates of referral.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In MS, the relation between clinical and MR imaging measures is still suboptimal. We assessed the correlation of disability and specific impairment of the clinical functional system with overall and regional CNS damage in a large cohort of patients with MS with different clinical phenotypes by using a random forest approach.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain conventional MR imaging and DTI were performed in 172 patients with MS and 46 controls. Cervical cord MR imaging was performed in a subgroup of subjects. To evaluate whether MR imaging measures were able to correctly classify impairment in specific clinical domains, we performed a random forest analysis.RESULTS: Between-group differences were found for most of the MR imaging variables, which correlated significantly with clinical measures (r ranging from −0.57 to 0.55). The random forest analysis showed a high performance in identifying impaired versus unimpaired patients, with a global error between 7% (pyramidal functional system) and 31% (Ambulation Index) in the different outcomes considered. When considering the performance in the unimpaired and impaired groups, the random forest analysis showed a high performance in identifying patients with impaired sensory, cerebellar, and brain stem functions (error below 10%), while it performed poorly in defining impairment of visual and mental systems (error of 91% and 70%, respectively). In analyses with a good level of classification, for most functional systems, damage of the WM fiber bundles subserving their function, measured by using DTI tractography, had the highest classification power.CONCLUSIONS: Random forest analysis, especially if applied to DTI tractography data, is a valuable approach, which might contribute to overcoming the MS clinical−MR imaging paradox.},

abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) strengthens synapses that are activated immediately before a postsynaptic spike, and weakens those that are activated after a spike. To prevent an uncontrolled growth of the synaptic strengths, weakening must dominate strengthening for uncorrelated spike times. However, this weight-normalization property would preclude Hebbian potentiation when the pre- and postsynaptic neurons are strongly active without specific spike-time correlations. We show that nonlinear STDP as inherent in the data of Markram et al. (1997) Science 275:213-215 can preserve the benefits of both weight normalization and Hebbian plasticity, and hence can account for learning based on spike-time correlations and on mean firing rates. As examples we consider the moving-threshold property of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, the development of direction-selective simple cells by changing short-term synaptic depression, and the joint adaptation of axonal and dendritic delays. Without threshold nonlinearity at low frequencies, the development of direction selectivity does not stabilize in a natural stimulation environment. Without synaptic unreliability there is no causal development of axonal and dendritic delays},

abstract = {Most people are caring and will exert great effort to rescue individual victims whose needy plight comes to their attention. These same good people, however, often become numbly indifferent to the plight of individuals who are “one of many” in a much greater problem. Why does this occur? The answer to this question will help us answer a related question that is the topic of this paper: Why, over the past century, have good people repeatedly ignored mass murder and genocide? Every episode of mass murder is unique and raises unique obstacles to intervention. But the repetitiveness of such atrocities, ignored by powerful people and nations, and by the general public, calls for explanations that may reflect some fundamental deficiency in our humanity — a deficiency that, once identified, might possibly be overcome. One fundamental mechanism that may play a role in many, if not all, episodes of mass-murder neglect involves the capacity to experience affect, the positive and negative feelings that combine with reasoned analysis to guide our judgments, decisions, and actions. I shall draw from psychological research to show how the statistics of mass murder or genocide, no matter how large the numbers, fail to convey the true meaning of such atrocities. The reported numbers of deaths represent dry statistics, “human beings with the tears dried off,” that fail to spark emotion or feeling and thus fail to motivate action. Recognizing that we cannot rely only upon our moral feelings to motivate proper action against genocide, we must look to moral argument and international law. The 1948 Genocide Convention was supposed to meet this need, but it has not been effective. It is time to examine this failure in light of the psychological deficiencies described here and design legal and institutional mechanisms that will enforce proper response to genocide and other forms of mass murder.},

Specifically, bullet graphs support the comparison of the featured measure to one or more related measures (for example, a target or the same measure at some point in the past, such as a year ago) and relate the featured measure to defined quantitative ranges that declare its qualitative state (for example, good, satisfactory, and poor). Its linear design not only gives it a small footprint, but also supports more efficient reading than radial meters.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to estimate the passage of time is of fundamental importance for perceptual and cognitive processes. One experience of time is the perception of duration, which is not isomorphic to physical duration and can be distorted by a number of factors. Yet, the critical features generating these perceptual shifts in subjective duration are not understood.

METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We used prospective duration judgments within and across sensory modalities to examine the effect of stimulus predictability and feature change on the perception of duration. First, we found robust distortions of perceived duration in auditory, visual and auditory-visual presentations despite the predictability of the feature changes in the stimuli. For example, a looming disc embedded in a series of steady discs led to time dilation, whereas a steady disc embedded in a series of looming discs led to time compression. Second, we addressed whether visual (auditory) inputs could alter the perception of duration of auditory (visual) inputs. When participants were presented with incongruent audio-visual stimuli, the perceived duration of auditory events could be shortened or lengthened by the presence of conflicting visual information; however, the perceived duration of visual events was seldom distorted by the presence of auditory information and was never perceived shorter than their actual durations.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results support the existence of multisensory interactions in the perception of duration and, importantly, suggest that vision can modify auditory temporal perception in a pure timing task. Insofar as distortions in subjective duration can neither be accounted for by the unpredictability of an auditory, visual or auditory-visual event, we propose that it is the intrinsic features of the stimulus that critically affect subjective time distortions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COSMIN checklist (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments) was developed in an international Delphi study to evaluate the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties of health-related patient reported outcomes (HR-PROs). In this paper, we explain our choices for the design requirements and preferred statistical methods for which no evidence is available in the literature or on which the Delphi panel members had substantial discussion.

METHODS: The issues described in this paper are a reflection of the Delphi process in which 43 panel members participated.

RESULTS: The topics discussed are internal consistency (relevance for reflective and formative models, and distinction with unidimensionality), content validity (judging relevance and comprehensiveness), hypotheses testing as an aspect of construct validity (specificity of hypotheses), criterion validity (relevance for PROs), and responsiveness (concept and relation to validity, and (in) appropriate measures).

CONCLUSIONS: We expect that this paper will contribute to a better understanding of the rationale behind the items, thereby enhancing the acceptance and use of the COSMIN checklist.},

abstract = {The International Council of Nurses (ICN) is a federation of 129 national
nurses associations. The International Classification for Nursing
Practice (ICNP) is a programme of the ICN. The purpose of this paper
is to describe the development and maintenance processes of the ICNP
Programme that are used to increase participation. These include
processes by which the ICNP was and continues to be developed, tested,
distributed and implemented worldwide, with emphasis on the current
version, ICNP Version 1.0. The ICNP is a unified nursing language
that facilitates cross-mapping among local terms and existing terminologies.
ICNP conforms to current terminology standards and criteria, for
example, ISO standards and HL7. The ICNP Alpha and Beta Versions
documented the progress of concept validation and classification
of nursing phenomena and interventions. The ICNP Beta 2 Version was
a combinatorial terminology organized in two multi-axial structures
representing nursing phenomena and nursing actions. The ICNP Version
1.0, launched in 2005, changed the relatively straight-forward multi-axial
structure into a compositional terminology through the application
of description logics using Web Ontology Language (OWL) within Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}},
an ontology development environment. ICNP Version 1.0 is also represented
in a multiaxial model (7-Axis) for nurses to compose nursing diagnosis,
intervention and outcome statements. Language translations and clinical
information systems applications are required to make the ICNP Version
1.0 available to nurses at the point of healthcare delivery. ICNP
data collected in healthcare environments provide standardized terminology
for nursing that allows comparison of nursing practice across health
care settings, specialties and countries; facilitate data-based clinical
and management decision making; and contribute to the development
of guidelines and standards for best practices and optimal outcomes
for patients, families and communities.},

Ss were a total of 202 passersby on a university campus. All 3 experiments included a condition in which a requester first asked for an extreme favor (which was refused to him) and then for a smaller favor. In each instance, this procedure produced more compliance with the smaller favor than a procedure in which the requester asked solely for the smaller favor. Additional control conditions in each experiment support the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by a rule for reciprocation of concessions. Several advantages to the use of the rejection-then-moderation procedure for producing compliance are discussed. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

The grandiose exhibitionism subscale of the narcissistic personality inventory was hypothesized to predict the self-promoting behaviors.

We used G theory to estimate the amount of measurement error due to code (language or dialect). Fourth - and fifth-grade ELLs, native speakers of Haitian-Creole from two speech communities, were given the same set of mathematics items in the standard English and standard Haitian-Creole dialects (Sample 1) or in the standard and local dialects of Haitian-Creole (Samples 2 and 3). The largest measurement error observed was produced by the interaction of student, item and code. Our results indicate that the reliability and dependability of ELL achievement measures is affected by two facts that operate in combination: Each test item poses a unique set of linguistic challenges and each student has a unique set of linguistic strengths and weaknesses. This sensitivity to language appears to take place at the level of dialect. Also, students from different speech communities within the same broad linguistic group may differ considerably in the number of items needed to obtain dependable measures of their academic achievement. Whether students are tested in English or in their first language, dialect variation needs to be considered if language as a source of measurement error is to be effectively addressed.},

abstract = {Research on the perception of faces has focused on the size, shape, and configuration of inherited features or the biological phenotype, and largely ignored the effects of adornment, or the extended phenotype. Research on the evolution of signaling has shown that animals frequently alter visual features, including color cues, to attract, intimidate or protect themselves from conspecifics. Humans engage in conscious manipulation of visual signals using cultural tools in real time rather than genetic changes over evolutionary time. Here, we investigate one tool, the use of color cosmetics. In two studies, we asked viewers to rate the same female faces with or without color cosmetics, and we varied the style of makeup from minimal (natural), to moderate (professional), to dramatic (glamorous). Each look provided increasing luminance contrast between the facial features and surrounding skin. Faces were shown for 250 ms or for unlimited inspection time, and subjects rated them for attractiveness, competence, likeability and trustworthiness. At 250 ms, cosmetics had significant positive effects on all outcomes. Length of inspection time did not change the effect for competence or attractiveness. However, with longer inspection time, the effect of cosmetics on likability and trust varied by specific makeup looks, indicating that cosmetics could impact automatic and deliberative judgments differently. The results suggest that cosmetics can create supernormal facial stimuli, and that one way they may do so is by exaggerating cues to sexual dimorphism. Our results provide evidence that judgments of facial trustworthiness and attractiveness are at least partially separable, that beauty has a significant positive effect on judgment of competence, a universal dimension of social cognition, but has a more nuanced effect on the other universal dimension of social warmth, and that the extended phenotype significantly influences perception of biologically important signals at first glance and at longer inspection.},

They are established tools in a wide range of industrial applications, including search engines, DNA sequencing, stock market analysis, and robot locomotion, and their use is spreading rapidly. People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.\n\nFINDINGS: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

However, they prefer to model item response probabilities than to study the internal structure of cognitive attributes. The theory of conjoint measurement, via its unique capacity to detect the quantitative structure of non-extensive attributes, can be used for the latter purpose. It is shown that conjoint systems analogous to the numerical composition rules advanced by the Rasch, many facet Rasch and two-parameter logistic models can be formulated using well-established axioms, representation theorems and proofs. Examples using empirical and synthetic data are presented. It was concluded that the lack of descriptive, behavioural theory remains the biggest obstacle to the scientific measurement of cognitive abilities.},

There are individual differences in rational thinking that are less than perfectly correlated with individual differences in intelligence because intelligence and rationality occupy different conceptual locations in models of cognition. A tripartite extension of currently popular dual-process theories is presented in this chapter that illustrates how intelligence and rationality are theoretically separate concepts. The chapter concludes by showing how this tripartite model of mind, taken in the context of studies of individual differences, can help to resolve the Great Rationality Debate.},

@article{Ommen2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to develop a theory-based and empirically tested instrument for measuring patient-reported 'psychosocial care by physicians'. We propose a model integrating patients' perceptions with respect to: (i) devotion by physicians, (ii) support by physicians, (iii) information by physicians and (iv) shared decision-making (SDM). DESIGN: Data were gathered during 2001 within a cross-sectional, retrospective mail survey. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 4192 inpatients of six German hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Specific scales of the Cologne Patient Questionnaire were used. A two-step structural equation model procedure was applied. In the first structural equation model, all items were modeled as indicators of the intended underlying latent construct, 'psychosocial care by physicians'. In the second structural equation model, criterion-related validity of the intended construct was tested with respect to patients' 'satisfaction', 'trust in physicians' and the 'image of the hospital'. RESULTS: The results confirmed that the aspects of psychosocial care provided by physicians measured by the scale items are indeed indicators of the same construct. Furthermore, indicator reliabilities and selectivities revealed that the content of all 13 items was highly representative of the underlying construct. The second structural equation model showed that 'psychosocial care by physicians' is related to 'patients' satisfaction', 'trust in physicians' and 'hospital-image' in a significant and relevant manner. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our instrument's reported psychometric characteristics and of the initial validity indicators, it may be regarded as an adequate measure for further use in outcome and intervention research, and as a quality indicator for the physician-patient relationship.},

abstract = {During binocular rivalry, conflicting monocular images compete for access to consciousness in a stochastic, dynamical fashion. Recent human neuroimaging and psychophysical studies suggest that rivalry entails competitive interactions at multiple neural sites, including sites that retain eye-selective information. Rivalry greatly suppresses activity in the ventral pathway and attenuates visual adaptation to form and motion; nonetheless, some information about the suppressed stimulus reaches higher brain areas. Although rivalry depends on low-level inhibitory interactions, high-level excitatory influences promoting perceptual grouping and selective attention can extend the local dominance of a stimulus over space and time. Inhibitory and excitatory circuits considered within a hybrid model might account for the paradoxical properties of binocular rivalry and provide insights into the neural bases of visual awareness itself.},

The key performance dimensions include:  (1) Link Best Practices to Strategy Fulfillment (2) Best Practice Identification Systems (3) Best Practice Recognition Systems (4) Communicating Best Practices (5) Best Practice Knowledge Sharing Systems (6) Ongoing Nurturing of Best Practices Graphical Presentations, Best Practice Project Maps and Research Organization: The sub-elements to the fully integrated performance system are graphically depicted at the start of the report. At the start of each chapter, a Best Practice Project Map describes: (1) the class of benchmark companies examined in the chapter, (2) the key performance dimensions of the project with the chapter concentration highlighted, and (3) the recommended practices identified among the benchmark class in that sub-element.  Best Practice Corporate Profiles, Information Graphics: Best practice descriptions and information are organized and presented under the thematic headings or sub-elements for each performance system. Highly effective practices are identified in bold-faced type and are followed by detailed descriptions of individual companies specific systems and approaches to these practices. For instance, a practice under Communicating Best Practices such as Ensure Communication Among Line and Staff Management is illustrated by a discussion of the various methods Wal-Mart uses to ensure corporate-wide communication (including Saturday morning executive meetings, and video links connecting all stores). At times, the corporate profiles will go into great depth and detail describing a benchmark company's integrated approach to the subject area. Other times the profile will be brief and illustrate a single relevant practice. When relevant, the research team has developed tables and information graphics to visually illustrate key practice areas.

abstract = {A substantial body of evidence collected by Batson and his associates has advanced the idea that pure (i.e., selfless) altruism occurs under conditions of empathy for a needy other. An egoistic alternative account of this evidence was proposed and tested in our work. We hypothesized that an observer's heightened empathy for a sufferer brings with it increased personal sadness in the observer and that it is the egoistic desire to relieve the sadness, rather than the selfless desire to relieve the sufferer, that motivates helping. Two experiments contrasted predictions from the selfless and egoistic alternatives in the paradigm typically used by Batson and his associates. In the first, an emphatic orientation to a victim increased personal sadness, as expected. Furthermore, when sadness and empathic emotion were separated experimentally, helping was predicted by the levels of sadness subjects were experiencing but not by their empathy scores. In the second experiment, enhanced sadness was again associated with empathy for a victim. However, subjects who were led to perceive that their moods could not be altered through helping (because of the temporary action of a "mood-fixing" placebo drug) were not helpful, despite high levels of empathic emotion. The results were interpreted as providing support for an egoistically based interpretation of helping under conditions of high empathy.},

abstract = {One of the major obstacles in the learning process is temptation, which has the power to divert students from even their most important goals (e.g. getting a degree). In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive reappraisal could be used to successfully resist temptation. Participants had to memorize tedious material while being tempted by pictures pasted on the wall (Study 1) or by funny clips on the television (Study 2). In Study 1, compared to a control group, participants who were instructed to reappraise the task as an opportunity to improve their memory (1) were less tempted by the pictures, (2) maintained their enthusiasm for the task, and (3) showed better performance in a subsequent memory test. Study 2 replicated and extended the findings from Study 1, showing that cognitive reappraisal is effective whether the target of reappraisal is the temptation itself, or the longer term goal. Taken together, our findings provide compelling evidence that cognitive reappraisal (of either the task or the temptation) may be a useful tool for increasing students' task performance and enthusiasm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

@article{Joachims2002,
abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a relatively new learning method used for binary classification. The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVMs introduce the notion of a kernel induced feature space which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVMs is that the higher-dimensional space doesnt need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a systems likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVMs can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVMs are intuitive, theoretically well- founded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVMs have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than yes/no classification).},

Results corroborated the psychometric qualities of the instrument with the exception of one item and suggest that the two- factor solution is more desirable from a psychometric point of view.

abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you'll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you're working with–business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances–this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it.  You'll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world's most talented designers and visual journalists, including Cond{\'{e}} Nast Traveler's John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine's Fernando Baptista, The New York Times' Steve Duenes, The Washington Post's Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford's Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world's leading designers. The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals: • Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art • How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking  • The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ • Best practices for creating interactive information graphics • A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ • An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world's top designers and visual artistsOn the DVD-ROM:In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You'll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition. You will find a link in the last few pages of your eBook that directs you to the media files.  Helpful tips: If you are able to search the book, search for "Where are the lesson files?"  Go to the very last page of the book and scroll backwards. You will need a web-enabled device or computer in order to access the media files that accompany this ebook. Entering the URL supplied into a computer with web access will allow you to get to the files. Depending on your device, it is possible that your display settings will cut off part of the URL. To make sure this is not the case, try reducing your font size and turning your device to a landscape view. This should cause the full URL to appear.},

abstract = {Despite the social importance of decisions taken in the ‘‘heat of the moment,'' very little research has examined the effect of sexual arousal on judgment and decision making. Here we examine the effect of sexual arousal, induced by self-stimulation, on judgments and hypothetical decisions made by male college students. Students were assigned to be in either a state of sexual arousal or a neutral state and were asked to: (1) indicate how appealing they find a wide range of sexual stimuli and activities, (2) report their willingness to engage in morally questionable behavior in order to obtain sexual gratification, and (3) describe their willingness to engage in unsafe sex when sexually aroused. The results show that sexual arousal had a strong impact on all three areas of judgment and decision making, demonstrating the importance of situational forces on preferences, as well as subjects' inability to predict these},

abstract = {Describes how motivational processes influence a child's acquisition, transfer, and use of knowledge and skills. Recent research within the social-cognitive framework illustrates adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns, and a research-based model of motivational processes is presented that shows how the particular performance or learning goals children pursue on cognitive tasks shape their reactions to success and failure and influence the quality of their cognitive performance. Implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes are outlined. It is suggested that motivational patterns may contribute to gender differences in mathematics achievement and that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies and provide a basis for more effective socialization.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare outpatient hysteroscopy with day case hysteroscopy in terms of patient satisfaction and acceptability. SETTING: Gynaecology clinic of a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 100 women. Design and interventions: Patients were randomly allocated to outpatient hysteroscopy or day case hysteroscopy provided they had no preference for either procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Satisfaction rate, requirements for postoperative analgesia, speed of recovery, time away from home, and time off work. RESULTS: The outpatient group recovered preoperative fitness more quickly than the day case group (2 days (range 1-2.7) versus 3 days (2-4), P<0.05). After the procedure, the outpatient group were also fully mobile more quickly than the day case group (0 minutes (0-5) versus 105 minutes (80-120), P<0.001). Requirements for postoperative analgesia were similar in both groups. Overall, 78% of patients considered that the pain from outpatient hysteroscopy was less than that usually experienced during menstruation. Patient satisfaction was similar in both groups (83.6% in the outpatient group versus 77.0% in the day case group). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient hysteroscopy and day case hysteroscopy were equally acceptable to patients. Patients recovered significantly more quickly from outpatient hysteroscopy than from day case hysteroscopy.},

This is possible if a null hypothesis is explicitly formulated when the experiment is designed; this hypothesis can never be proved, but may be disproved with whatever probability one will accept as demonstrating a positive result. Chapters II, III, and IV illustrate simple applications of the principles involved in sensitiveness, significance, tests of wider hypotheses, validity, and estimation and elimination of error. More elaborate structures are treated in later chapters. Chapter titles are: (V) the Latin square; (VI) factorial design in experimentation; (VII) confounding; (VIII) special cases of partial confounding; (IX) increase of precision by concomitant measurements: statistical control; (X) generalization of null hypotheses: fiducial probability; (XI) measurement of amount of information in general.},

@article{Mueller2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:The recovery of patients after an acute episode of illness
or injury depends both on adequate medical treatment and on the early
identification of needs for rehabilitation care. The process of early
beginning rehabilitation requires efficient communication both between
health professionals and the patient in order to effectively address
all rehabilitation goals. The currently used nursing taxonomies,
however, are not intended for interdisciplinary use and thus may
not contribute to efficient rehabilitation management and an optimal
patient outcome. The ICF might be the missing link in this communication
process. The objective of this study was to identify the categories
of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health (ICF) categories relevant for nursing care in the situation
of acute and early post-acute rehabilitation.METHODS:First, in a
consensus process, "Leistungserfassung in der Pflege" (LEP) nursing
interventions relevant for the situation of acute and early post-acute
rehabilitation were selected. Second, in an integrated two-step linking
process, two nursing experts derived goals of LEP nursing interventions
from their practical knowledge and selected corresponding ICF categories
most relevant for patients in acute and post-acute rehabilitation
(ICF Core Sets).RESULTS:Eighty-seven percent of ICF Core Set categories
could be linked to goals of at least one nursing intervention variable
of LEP. The ICF categories most frequently linked with LEP nursing
interventions were respiration functions, experience of self and
time functions and focusing attention. Thirteen percent of ICF Core
Set categories could not be linked with LEP nursing interventions.
The LEP nursing interventions which were linked with the highest
number of different ICF-categories of all were "therapeutic intervention",
"patient-nurse communication/information giving" and "mobilising".CONCLUSION:The
ICF Core Sets for the acute hospital and early post-acute rehabilitation
facilities are highly relevant for rehabilitation nursing. Linking
nursing interventions with ICF Core Set categories is a feasible
way to analyse nursing. Using the ICF Core Sets to describe goals
of nursing interventions both facilitates inter-professional communication
and respects patient's needs. The ICF may thus be a useful framework
to set nursing intervention goals.},

These guidelines support the primary objective of data visualization, i.e. to effectively convey information.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of program interventions in a school-based teen pregnancy program on hypothesized constructs underlying teens' attitudes toward sexuality. An important task related to this purpose was the validation of the constructs and their stability from pre- to postintervention measures. Data from 1,136 middle grade students were obtained from an earlier evaluation of an abstinence-based teen pregnancy prevention program (S. Weed, I. Ericksen, G. Grant, & A. Lewis, 2002). Latent trait structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention program on changes in constructs of teens' attitudes toward sexuality. Gender was also taken into consideration. This investigation provides credible evidence that both 1st- and 2nd-order constructs related to measures of teens' attitudes toward risky sexual behavior are sufficiently stable and sensitive to detect program effects.},

abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The Comprehensive International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set for Breast Cancer is an application
of the ICF, and represents the typical spectrum of problems in functioning
and contextual factors that may influence functioning of patients
with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to examine the
content validity of this ICF core set from the perspective of physiotherapists.
DESIGN Physiotherapists from around the world experienced in the
treatment of patients with breast cancer were interviewed about patients'
problems, patients' resources and environmental aspects that physiotherapists
take care of in a three-round survey using the Delphi technique.
The responses were linked to the ICF. The degree of agreement was
calculated by means of the Kappa statistic. PARTICIPANTS Physiotherapists
experienced in breast cancer treatment. RESULTS Fifty-nine physiotherapists
from 19 countries named 769 problems treated by physiotherapists
in patients with breast cancer. One hundred and sixty-six ICF categories
were linked to these answers. Nineteen ICF categories reached >75%
agreement among the physiotherapists but are not represented in the
Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Breast Cancer. Ten concepts were linked
to the not-yet-classified personal factors component. Eleven concepts
are not covered by the ICF. The Kappa coefficient for the agreement
between the two persons who performed the linking was 0.66 (95% bootstrapped
confidence interval 0.63 to 0.68). CONCLUSIONS The content validity
of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Breast Cancer was largely supported
by the physiotherapists. However, several issues were raised which
were not covered and these need to be investigated further.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although abortion or termination of pregnancy (TOP) has become an increasingly normalized component of women's health care over the past forty years, insufficient attention has been paid to women's experiences of surgical or medical methods of TOP.

OBJECTIVE: To undertake a narrative review of qualitative studies of women's experiences of TOP and their perspectives on surgical or medical methods.

METHODS: Keyword searches of Medline, CINAHL, ISI, and IBSS databases. Manual searches of other relevant journals and reference lists of primary articles.

RESULTS: Qualitative studies (n = 18) on women's experiences of abortion were identified. Analysis of the results of studies reviewed revealed three main themes: experiential factors that promote or inhibit the choice to seek TOP; experiences of TOP; and experiential aspects of the environment in which TOP takes place.

CONCLUSION: Women's choices about TOP are mainly pragmatic ones that are related to negotiating finite personal and family and emotional resources. Women who are well informed and supported in their choices experience good psychosocial outcomes from TOP. Home TOP using mifepristone appears attractive to women who are concerned about professionals' negative attitudes and lack of privacy in formal healthcare settings but also leads to concerns about management and safety.},

abstract = {Exploratory data analysis is detective work–numerical detective work–or counting detective work–or graphical detective work. A detective investigating a crime needs both tools and under-standing. If he has no fingerprint powder, he will fail to find fingerprints on most surfaces. If he does not understand where the criminal is likely to have put his fingers, he will will not look in the right places. Equally, the analyst of data needs both tools and understanding (p 1: Tukey (1977)) As discussed in Chapter 1 the challenge of psychometrics is assign numbers to observations in a way that best summarizes the underlying constructs. The ways to collect observations are multiple and can be based upon comparisons of order or of proximity (Chapter 2). But given a set of observations, how best to describe them? This is a problem not just for observational but also for experimental psychologists for both approaches are attempting to make inferences about latent variables in terms of statistics based upon observed variables (Figure 3.1). For the experimentalist, the problem becomes interpreting the effect of an experimental manipulation upon some outcome variable (path B in Figure 3.1 in terms of the effect of manipulation on the latent outcome variable (path b) and the relationship between the latent and observed outcome variables (path s). For the observationalist, the observed correlation between the observed Person Variable and Outcome variable (path A) is interpreted as a function of the relationship between the latent person trait variable and the observed trait variable (path r), the latent outcome variable and the observed outcome variable (path s), and most importantly for inference, the relationship between the two latent variables (path a). Paths r and s are influenced by the reliability (Chapter 7), the validity (Chapter 9) and the shape of the functions r and s mapping the latents to the observed variables. The problem of measurement is a question about the shape of these relationships. But before it is possible to discuss shape it is necessary to consider the kinds of relationships that are possible. This requires a consideration of how to assign numbers to the data. Consider the set of observations organized into a data.frame, s.df, in Table 3.1. Copy this table into the clipboard, and read the clipboard into the data.frame, s.df. 1 A data.frame is an essential element in R and has many (but not all) the properties of a matrix. Unlike a matrix, the column entries can be of different data types (strings, logical, integer, or numeric). Data.frames have dimensions (the number of rows and columns), and a structure. To see the structure of a data.frame (or any other R object, use the str function. 1 Because $\theta$ is read as X., we add the command colnames(s.df)[4] <-"theta" to match the table.},

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal.

abstract = {In the previous chapter, the variance was introduced as a measure of the dispersion of a univariate distribution. Additional statistics are required to describe the joint distribution of two or more variables. The covariance provides a natural measure of the association between two variables, and it appears in the analysis of many problems in quantitative genetics including the resemblance between relatives, the correlation between characters, and measures of selection. As a prelude to the formal theory of covariance and regression, we first pro- vide a brief review of the theory for the distribution of pairs of random variables. We then give a formal definition of the covariance and its properties. Next, we show how the covariance enters naturally into statistical methods for estimating the linear relationship between two variables (least-squares linear regression) and for estimating the goodness-of-fit of such linear trends (correlation). Finally, we apply the concept of covariance to several problems in quantitative-genetic the- ory. More advanced topics associated with multiv},

The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There is a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visu- alization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique and the interaction and distortion technique. We exemplify the clas- sification using a few examples, most of them referring to techniques and systems presented in this special issue},

abstract = {The information processing capacity of the human mind is limited, as is evidenced by the so-called "attentional-blink" deficit: When two targets (T1 and T2) embedded in a rapid stream of events are presented in close temporal proximity, the second target is often not seen. This deficit is believed to result from competition between the two targets for limited attentional resources. Here we show, using performance in an attentional-blink task and scalp-recorded brain potentials, that meditation, or mental training, affects the distribution of limited brain resources. Three months of intensive mental training resulted in a smaller attentional blink and reduced brain-resource allocation to the first target, as reflected by a smaller T1-elicited P3b, a brain-potential index of resource allocation. Furthermore, those individuals that showed the largest decrease in brain-resource allocation to T1 generally showed the greatest reduction in attentional-blink size. These observations provide novel support for the view that the ability to accurately identify T2 depends upon the efficient deployment of resources to T1. The results also demonstrate that mental training can result in increased control over the distribution of limited brain resources. Our study supports the idea that plasticity in brain and mental function exists throughout life and illustrates the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study of the human mind.},

abstract = {By both random and nonrandom assignments of numbers to rank orders (which are consistent with the monotonic nature of the categories), it is shown that ordinal variables can be treated as if they conform to interval scales. The scoring systems, of which 18 were randomly generated by a computer, resulted in negligible error when comparing any assigned scoring system with any selected "true" scoring system. Errors are determined by the Pearsonian correlation coefficient (r) and r^2. The advantages of treating ordinal variables as interval are demonstrated with regard to the relation between occupational prestige and suicide. These advantages include: (1) the use of more powerful, sensitive, better developed and interpretable statistics with known sampling error, (2) the retention of more knowledge about the characteristics of the data, and (3) greater versatility in statistical manipulation (e.g., partial and multiple correlation and regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and most pictorial presentations). The computer approach to this problem does not exhaust all possibilities for assigning numbers, which partially limits the generality of the findings.},

We found reliable evidence that persons who scored high (vs. low) in Neuroticism reported more daily problems, tended to react with more severe emotions, experienced more mood spillover from prior occasions, and exhibited stronger reactions to recurring problems (the "neurotic cascade"). The susceptibility of neurotics to stress seems to extend to all types of problems while certain other dimensions of personality (e.g., Agreeableness) are associated with hyperreactivity to particular kinds of problems. The research demonstrates how daily process research can provide insight about classic problems in the field of individual differences.},

@article{Valenstein2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are common in primary care and cause
substantial disability, but they often remain undiagnosed. Screening
is a frequently proposed strategy for increasing detection of depression.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-utility of screening for depression
compared with no screening. DESIGN: Nonstationary Markov model. DATA
SOURCES: The published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical
cohort of 40-year-old primary care patients. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care payer and societal. INTERVENTIONS: Self-administered
questionnaire followed by provider assessment. OUTCOME MEASURES:
Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE
ANALYSIS: Compared with no screening, the cost to society of annual
screening for depression in primary care patients is 192 444/QALY.
Screening every 5 years and one-time screening cost 50 988/QALY
and 32 053/QALY, respectively, compared with no screening. From
the payer perspective, the cost of annual screening is 225 467.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Cost-utility ratios are most sensitive
to the prevalence of major depression, the costs of screening, rates
of treatment initiation, and remission rates with treatment. In Monte
Carlo sensitivity analyses, the cost-utility of annual screening
is less than 50 000/QALY only 2.2% of the time. In multiway analyses,
four model variables must be changed to extreme values for the cost-utility
of annual screening to fall below 50 000/QALY, but a change in only
one variable increases the cost-utility of one-time screening to
more than 50 000/QALY. One-time screening is more robustly cost-effective
if screening costs are low and effective treatments are being given.
CONCLUSIONS: Annual and periodic screening for depression cost more
than 50 000/QALY, but one-time screening is cost-effective. The
cost-effectiveness of screening is likely to improve if treatment
becomes more effective.},

and Submit a term and definition for international utilisation to
the International Council of Nurses (ICN) for consideration for inclusion
in the ICNP. BACKGROUND South Africa was one of four African countries
(Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe) funded by the WK
Kellogg Foundation to participate in the ICNP project. South Africa
had 2 research groups. One of the research groups identified the
term cultural diversity to define. METHOD This was a qualitative
study where a philosophical perspective was used to explore, explain
and describe nursing practice. The combined method proposed by the
International Council of Nurses (ICN) was utilised to define and
validate the term cultural diversity. FINDINGS Validation and literature
review provided sufficient support for the defined characteristics
and the term was finally defined and submitted to ICN in November
2002 as: CULTURAL DIVERSITY is a type of CULTURE with the specific
characteristics: co-existence of different groups, e.g. ethnic, religious,
linguistic and other groups each with their own values and belief
systems, traditions and different lifestyles. CONCLUSION The research
group was informed in December 2003 of the ICNP Evaluation Committee
recommendation that the term cultural diversity will be included
in the ICNP.},

We begin with an exploration of different perspectives of empathy; from its behavioural and measurable characteristics to its less tangible, intuitive qualities. By drawing upon both policy and research, it is clear that patients want empathic and emotionally competent nurses. Nurse educators therefore have a responsibility to provide an education that engenders empathic understanding. We explore the implications of these findings for nurse education, identifying key areas for consideration in the preparation of emotionally skilled, empathic student nurses.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the development, validity and application of a new instrument (PREPARED) for obtaining feedback from community consumers of discharge planning activities. DESIGN: Iterative qualitative and quantitative investigations. SETTING: The community catchment area of a metropolitan Australian tertiary public hospital. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged over 65 years, with a range of conditions, recently discharged from hospital, their carers, and hospital nursing staff. ACTIONS: PREPARED was constructed from interviews with patients, carers and hospital staff. It was trialed and modified to ensure sensitive measurement of key attributes of discharge planning process and outcome. This paper explores the patient and carer versions of PREPARED. Data items were reduced to domains of key questions by factor analysis. Instrument performance was assessed by correlation of process and outcome measures, by comparing PREPARED responses with subsequent unstructured interview data, and by testing whether PREPARED responses were independent of health-related quality of life at the time of survey. RESULTS: Four key process domains were identified: information exchange (community services and equipment), medication management, preparation for coping after discharge and control of discharge circumstances. Outcome was measured as overall satisfaction with discharge, whether equipment and community service needs had been met, use of health services and health related costs post-discharge. The instrument performed well when compared with interview data, the process and outcome domains were largely independent of each other, as were responses to PREPARED and SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: PREPARED offers a comprehensive way of closing the quality improvement loop, by providing information from the community perspective on the quality of planning for discharge from the acute hospital setting.},

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.},

@article{Simpson1969,
abstract = {This experiment examined the effects on pupil size of the relevance of an overt response to a cognitive task. Sixteen Ss were assigned to two experimental groups. In one group Ss were required to judge the pitch equality of tones and, subsequently, indicate their decision by pressing or not pressing a telegraph key. In the other group Ss were required to make the pitch-discriminations, but the key press response was unrelated to the preceding cognitive task. Continuous photographs of each S's pupil were taken during the experiment. Results showed that a small amount of pupillary dilation occurred during the discrimination task in the group where the key press was irrelevant to the pitch-discrimination. In the group where S's behavior indicated task fulfillment, however, a significantly greater increase in pupil size occurred, the amount of dilation being larger when task completion was indicated by the key press response than when fulfillment was indicated by no key press. The findings were discussed in terms of arousal associated with apprehension about evaluation, and muscle tension from anticipation of making the overt response.

abstract = {The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is one of the most popular measures of mindfulness, exhibiting promising psychometric properties and theoretically consistent relationships to brain activity, mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) outcomes, and mediation of MBI effects. The present study investigated the response patterns and scale properties in a large sample of undergraduate students (N= 414) using Item Response Theory analyses. The findings suggest that general statements of " automatic inattentiveness" or " automatic pilot" confer greater statistical information about the underlying latent trait. Evidence of limited abilities to report on mindlessness and of response bias to " mindfulness-absent" items suggests challenges to the construct validity of the MAAS. The current findings, along with pre-existing data, suggest that reverse-scoring the scale may be inadequate to represent intentional attention or awareness. Further research is needed to determine which variations, components, and correlates of the numerous operationalizations of mindfulness are theoretically consistent and most salient to positive outcomes, especially in psychopathology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, it is not known which type of pacemaker results in superior clinical and patient outcomes. To date, there is no feasible and validated disease-specific questionnaire for pacemaker patients to assess quality of life (QoL) available. The Aquarel questionnaire was developed as a disease-specific extension to the Short-Form-36 (SF-36). A cross-sectional study was carried out in 74 pacemaker patients to evaluate validity and reliability of this instrument. Items were selected and scales constructed based on factorial analysis. Internal consistency, content validity and test-retest reliability were moderate to excellent. Correlations with the SF-36 scales, pacing mode and functional tests were as hypothesized, demonstrating the individual value and distinctiveness of the Aquarel subscales. The results support the feasibility and usefulness of evaluating QoL in pacemaker patients when using Aquarel as an extension to the SF-36.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: recent studies have found that moderate intensity exercise
is an effective intervention strategy for preventing falls in older
people. However, research is required to determine whether supervised
group exercise programmes, conducted in community settings with at-risk
older people referred by their health care practitioner are also
effective in improving physical functioning and preventing falls
in this group. OBJECTIVES: to determine whether participation in
a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises over
one year improves balance, muscle strength, reaction time, physical
functioning, health status and prevents falls in at-risk community-dwelling
older people. METHODS: the sample comprised 163 people aged over
65 years identified as at risk of falling using a standardised assessment
screen by their general practitioner or hospital-based physiotherapist,
residing in South Western Sydney, Australia. Subjects were randomised
into either an exercise intervention group or a control group. Physical
performance and general health measures were assessed at baseline
and repeated 6-months into the trial. Falls were measured over a
12-month follow-up period using monthly postal surveys. RESULTS:
at baseline both groups were well matched in their physical performance,
health and activity levels. The intervention subjects attended a
median of 23 exercise classes over the year, and most undertook the
home exercise sessions at least weekly. At retest, the exercise group
performed significantly better than the controls in three of six
balance measures; postural sway on the floor with eyes open and eyes
closed and coordinated stability. The groups did not differ at retest
in measures of strength, reaction time and walking speed or on Short-Form
36, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly or fear of falling scales.
Within the 12-month trial period, the rate of falls in the intervention
group was 40% lower than that of the control group (IRR=0.60, 95%
CI 0.36-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: these findings indicate that participation
in a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises
can improve balance and reduce the rate of falling in at-risk community
dwelling older people.},

abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g., the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.},

abstract = {Background: The current study examined whether yoga would increase
levels of mindfulness in a healthy population. Method: Forty-six
participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week yoga intervention
group or a wait-list control group. Mindfulness was assessed pre
and post yoga, using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). Results:
Results indicate that the yoga group experienced a significant increase
in Overall mindfulness, and in three mindfulness subscales; Attention
to the present moment, Accepting and open attitudes toward experience,
and Insightful understanding (p < .01). The control group experienced
a significant increase in overall mindfulness (p < .02) and insightful
understanding (p < .01). Findings suggest that a yoga intervention
may be a viable method for increasing levels of trait mindfulness
in a healthy population, potentially implicating yoga as a preventive
method for the later development of negative emotional mood states
(i.e. anxiety and depression). The control group also experienced
moderate elevations of mindfulness at the second assessment.},

We hypothesized that meditation practice might also be associated with changes in the brain's physical structure. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between-group differences in prefrontal cortical thickness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age-related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for experience-dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice.},

The first part includes the introductions and elementary descriptive statistics; I want the students to be knee-deep in data right out of the gate. The second part is the study of probability, which begins at the basics of sets and the equally likely model, journeys past discrete/continuous random variables, and continues through to multivariate distributions. The chapter on sampling distributions paves the way to the third part, which is in- ferential statistics.

Students responded in writing both after an initial experience of qigong and after practicing the movements for 15 weeks during a mindfulness-based course in self-care. Themes of physical, emotional, and mental changes were present in both sets of responses. Additional themes of familiarity with the practice as well as group consciousness and interdependence emerged in the final experience of qigong. The results of this study indicate qigong is a contemplative practice that could have positive outcomes for counseling students. Because of its accessible nature, immediate results, and ability to foster connectedness, qigong is currently underutilized as a form of teaching mindfulness.},

Compared with conventional testing based on the booklet design of PISA 2006, unrestricted MAT increases measurement efficiency by 74% and reduces the average number of presented items from 55 to 26 without a loss in measurement precision. The incorporation of restrictions reduces the advantages of MAT. MAT is recommended for the assessment of newly introduced constructs but not for the assessment of the literacy domains in PISA.},

@article{Goossen2004,
abstract = {Objective Since 1999, the Nursing Terminology Summits have promoted
the development, evaluation, and use of reference terminology for
nursing and its integration into comprehensive health care data standards.
The use of such standards to represent nursing knowledge, terminology,
processes, and information in electronic health records will enhance
continuity of care, decision support, and the exchange of comparable
patient information. As part of this activity, working groups at
the 2001, 2002, and 2003 Summit Conferences examined how to represent
nursing information in the Health Level 7 (HL7) Reference Information
Model (RIM).Design The working groups represented the nursing process
as a dynamic sequence of phases, each containing information specific
to the activities of the phase. They used Universal Modeling Language
(UML) to represent this domain knowledge in models. An Activity Diagram
was used to create a dynamic model of the nursing process. After
creating a structural model of the information used at each stage
of the nursing process, the working groups mapped that information
to the HL7 RIM. They used a hierarchical structure for the organization
of nursing knowledge as the basis for a hierarchical model for “Findings
about the patient.��? The modeling and mapping reported here were
exploratory and preliminary, not exhaustive or definitive. The intent
was to evaluate the feasibility of representing some types of nursing
information consistently with HL7 standards.Measurements The working
groups conducted a small-scale validation by testing examples of
nursing terminology against the HL7 RIM class “Observation.��?Results
It was feasible to map patient information from the proposed models
to the RIM class “Observation.��? Examples illustrate the models
and the mapping of nursing terminology to the HL7 RIM.Conclusion
It is possible to model and map nursing information into the comprehensive
health care information model, the HL7 RIM. These models must evolve
and undergo further validation by clinicians. The integration of
nursing information, terminology, and processes in information models
is a first step toward rendering nursing information machine-readable
in electronic patient records and messages. An eventual practical
result, after much more development, would be to create computable,
structured information for nursing documentation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop an instrument for provider organizations, consumers, purchasers, and policy makers to measure and compare the development of quality systems in provider organizations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of provider organizations using a structured questionnaire to survey managers. SETTING: The Netherlands. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Provider organizations of six health care fields: primary health care, care for the disabled, mental health care, care for the elderly, hospital care and welfare care. MAIN MEASURES: Existence of quality assurance and quality improvement activities. RESULTS: The study presents a survey instrument for assessing the quality assurance and improvement activities of health care provider organizations and the developmental stage of quality systems. The survey instrument distinguishes five focal areas for quality improvement activities and four developmental stages. The study also reports data on the reliability and validity of the survey instrument. CONCLUSION: The instrument is reliable, easy to administer, and useful across health care fields as well as different kinds of organizations. Developing quality systems provide a common language across all parts of the health care sector. By assigning the activities to focal areas and developmental stages the instrument gives insight into the implementation of quality systems in health care. Comparable information on quality assurance activities increases the accountability of providers. Because of the efficient (not time consuming) approach, the instrument complements existing accreditation reviews.},

In the current study, long-term meditators and demographically similar nonmeditators completed self-report measures of constructs expected to be related to the practice of mindfulness meditation. Extent of meditation experience was correlated in the expected directions with levels of mindfulness and with many other variables. Mean differences between meditators and nonmeditators were significant in most cases. Mediation analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that practicing meditation is associated with increased mindfulness in daily life, which is related to decreased rumination, decreased fear of emotion, and increased behavioral self-regulation. These mechanisms appear partially responsible for the relationships between mindfulness skills and psychological adjustment. Overall, the current study suggests that the long-term practice of mindfulness meditation may cultivate mindfulness skills and promote adaptive functioning.},

abstract = {Measurement, the means by which numbers enter science, is of fundamental importance to modern science. The relationship between its qualitative and quantitative aspects has generated many theories and much controversy. In 19th century geometry similar developments led mathematician Felix Klein to devise a theory for unifying qualitative and quantitative approaches to geometry. Klein's theory, which today is called the Erlanger program, was based on transformation groups. In this article, the Erlanger program is given a new foundation based on mathematical logic and is extended to science. The current dominant theory of measurement in the literature, the representational theory, is then justified in terms of the new foundation for the Erlanger program. Certain inferential techniques used in dimensional analysis and the related technique of possible psychophysical laws are also given justifications in terms of the new foundation.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop and validate a self-completed
questionnaire, the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST), for
the detection of fibromyalgia syndrome in patients with diffuse chronic
pain. Items requiring "yes/no" responses and relating to the most
relevant clinical characteristics of fibromyalgia were compiled by
a group of rheumatologists and pain experts. The provisional questionnaire
was tested in a prospective multicenter study of 162 patients with
chronic pain due to fibromyalgia (according to ACR criteria) (n=92)
compared with a group of patients with chronic diffuse pain due to
other rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (n=32),
ankylosing spondylitis (n=25) and osteoarthritis (n=13). Identification
of the most discriminant combinations of items for fibromyalgia and
the calculation of their sensitivity and specificity were based on
both univariate and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analyses.
The assessment of the psychometric properties of the questionnaire
also dealt with face validity, content validity, test-retest reliability
and convergent/divergent validity. Based on univariate and multivariate
analyses, we retained only six items in the final version of FiRST.
These items were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and
predictive accuracy of the questionnaire. A cut-off score of 5 (corresponding
to the number of positive items) gave the highest rate of correct
identification of patients (87.9%), with a sensitivity of 90.5% and
a specificity of 85.7%. In conclusion, FiRST is a brief, simple and
straightforward self-administered questionnaire with excellent discriminative
value, of potential value for the detection of fibromyalgia in both
daily practice and clinical research.},

In the wake of Bem's (2011) recent, highly publicized study on psi phenomena in a prestigious journal, psychologists are again raising serious questions about their dominant research script. These concerns are echoed in the current paper, and Observation Oriented Modeling (OOM) is presented as an alternative approach toward data conceptualization and analysis for the social and life sciences. This approach is rooted in philosophical realism and an attitude toward data analysis centered around causality and common sense. Three example studies and accompanying data analyses are presented and discussed to demonstrate a number of OOM's advantages over current researcher practices.},

Design Systematic review of telemedicine satisfaction studies. Electronic databases searched include Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and the TIE (Telemedicine Information Exchange) database. Subjects Studies conducted worldwide and published between 1966 and 1998. Main outcome measures Quality of evidence about patient satisfaction. Results 32 studies were identified. Study methods used were simple survey instruments (26 studies), exact methods not specified (5), and qualitative methods (1). Study designs were randomised controlled trial (1 trial); random patient selection (2); case-control (1); and selection criteria not specified or participants represented consecutive referrals, convenience samples, or volunteers (28). Sample sizes were ≤ 20 (10 trials), ≤ 100 (14), >100 (7), and not specified (1). All studies reported good levels of patient satisfaction. Qualitative analysis revealed methodological problems with all the published work. Even so, important issues were highlighted that merit further investigation. There is a paucity of data examining patients' perceptions or the effects of this mode of healthcare delivery on the interaction between providers and clients. Conclusions Methodological deficiencies (low sample sizes, context, and study designs) of the published research limit the generalisability of the findings. The studies suggest that teleconsultation is acceptable to patients in a variety of circumstances, but issues relating to patient satisfaction require further exploration from the perspective of both clients and providers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:There is a growing awareness of the need for easily administered,
psychometrically sound screening tools to identify individuals with
elevated levels of psychological distress. Although support has been
found for the psychometric properties of the Depression, Anxiety
and Stress Scales (DASS) using classical test theory approaches it
has not been subjected to Rasch analysis. The aim of this study was
to use Rasch analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the
DASS-21 scales, using two different administration modes.METHODS:The
DASS-21 was administered to 420 participants with half the sample
responding to a web-based version and the other half completing a
traditional pencil-and-paper version. Conformity of DASS-21 scales
to a Rasch partial credit model was assessed using the RUMM2020 software.RESULTS:To
achieve adequate model fit it was necessary to remove one item from
each of the DASS-21 subscales. The reduced scales showed adequate
internal consistency reliability, unidimensionality and freedom from
differential item functioning for sex, age and mode of administration.
Analysis of all DASS-21 items combined did not support its use as
a measure of general psychological distress. A scale combining the
anxiety and stress items showed satisfactory fit to the Rasch model
after removal of three items.CONCLUSION:The results provide support
for the measurement properties, internal consistency reliability,
and unidimensionality of three slightly modified DASS-21 scales,
across two different administration methods. The further use of Rasch
analysis on the DASS-21 in larger and broader samples is recommended
to confirm the findings of the current study.},

There has been widespread and growing use of this approach within medical settings in the last 20 years, and many claims have been made regarding its efficacy. This article will provide a critical evaluation of the available state of knowledge regarding MBSR and suggestions for future research.\n\nMETHODS: A review of the current literature available within the medical and social sciences was undertaken to provide an evaluation regarding what we know about the construct of mindfulness, the effectiveness of MBSR, and mechanisms of action.\n\nRESULTS: There has been a paucity of research and what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this approach. However, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The available evidence does not support a strong endorsement of this approach at present. However, serious investigation is warranted and strongly recommended.},

abstract = {The detrimental effects of stress on human health are being increasingly recognized. There is a critical need for the establishment of a biomarker that accurately measures its intensity and course over time. Such a biomarker would allow monitoring of stress, increase understanding of its pathophysiology and may help identify appropriate and successful management strategies. Whereas saliva and urine cortisol capture real-time levels, hair cortisol analysis presents a complementary means of monitoring stress, capturing systemic cortisol exposure over longer periods of time. This novel approach for cortisol quantification is being increasingly used to identify the effects of stress in a variety of pathological situations, from chronic pain to acute myocardial infarctions. Because of its ability to provide a long-term, month-by-month measure of systemic cortisol exposure, hair cortisol analysis is becoming a useful tool, capable of answering clinical questions that could previously not be answered by other tests. In this paper we review the development, current status, limitations and outstanding questions regarding the use of hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress.},

for nursing documentation and for nurse protocols' description. We
implemented an ICNP browser and we integrated it into two different
systems: the nursing electronic patient record and the nursing protocols
editor. The former allows nurses to choose ICNP terms for filling
the clinical chart, while the latter allows computerising protocols
using ICNP terms for the actions specification. Since, in a nursing
information system, it should be worth to integrate protocols with
the electronic patient record, sharing the same terminology is a
crucial issue. We also show how we tailored the information system
to the different wards. For each ward, we devised the most frequent
patient needs and nursing actions. These lists are used to customise
the different interfaces. Finally, by testing the prototype using
real-world documents (clinical charts and protocols), we carried
out an evaluation of the terminology itself, about its completeness
and usability.},

We lack a theory of the functional properties of the human mind that could provide the needed integration?a theory about what the mechanisms of mind are "designed" to do. Evolutionary psychology provides the conceptual tools for emerging from this fragmented state. In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century.},

Participants in the study consisted of 481 21-22-year-old men and women who are part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Psychopathy was assessed by the degree of similarity between an individual's NEO-PI-R and an expert-generated FFM psychopathy prototype. The expert-based prototype supported the account of Widiger and Lynam (1998), as did the correlations between the NEO-PI-R Psychopathy Resemblance Index (PRI) and the individual personality dimensions. The PRI was also related in predicted ways to measures of antisocial behavior, drug use, and psychopathology. The results support the contention that psychopathy can be understood as an extreme variant of common dimensions of personality, and underscore the utility of a dimensional model of personality disorders.},

Strong Dirichlet model support for both the ordinal and quantitative components of unfolding was only found in datasets that satisfied at least double cancellation. In contrast, the Item Response Theory (IRT) simple hyperbolic cosine model for pairwise preferences (SHCMpp, Andrich 1995) fitted all datasets. The paper concluded the SHCMpp is suited to the instrumental rather than scientific task (Michell 2000) of psychological measurement; with the caveat of the problematic chi square fit statistic.

abstract = {The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) has the longest empirical
track record as a valid measure of trait mindfulness. Most of what
is understood about trait mindfulness comes from administering the
MAAS to relatively homogenous samples of Caucasian adults. This study
rigorously evaluates the psychometric properties of the MAAS among
Chinese adolescents attending high school in Chengdu, China. Classrooms
from 24 schools were randomly selected to participate in the study.
Three waves of longitudinal data (N = 5,287 students) were analyzed.
MAAS construct, nomological, and incremental validity were evaluated
as well as its measurement invariance across gender using latent
factor analyses. Participants' mean age was 16.2 years (SD = 0.7),
and 51% were male. The 15-item MAAS had adequate fit to the one-dimensional
factor structure at Wave 1, and this factor structure was replicated
at Wave 2. A 6-item short scale of the MAAS fit well to the data
at Wave 3. The MAAS maintained reliability (Cronbach's $\alpha$ = .89-.93;
test–restest r = .35-.52), convergent/discriminant validity, and
explained additional variance in mental health measures beyond other
psychosocial constructs. Both the 15- and 6-item MAAS scales displayed
at least partial factorial invariance across gender. The findings
suggest that the MAAS is a sound measure of trait mindfulness among
Chinese adolescents. To reduce respondent burden, the MAAS 6-item
short-scale provides an option to measure trait mindfulness.},

abstract = {In 2 experiments, a total of 200 female undergraduates rated the value and attractiveness of cookies that were either in abundant supply or scarce supply. In the scarce condition, the cookies were either constantly scarce or they began in abundant supply and then decreased. Ss were told that this decrease in supply was either due to an accident or to a high demand for the cookies. In the abundant condition, the cookies were either constantly abundant or first scarce and then abundant. The increase in supply was either due to an accident or to a lack of demand for the cookies. These conditions were crossed with a manipulation in which Ss thought either a high or low number of additional Ss were still to participate in the study. Results indicate that (a) cookies in scarce supply were rated as more desirable than cookies in abundant supply; (b) cookies were rated as more valuable when their supply changed from abundant to scarce than when they were constantly scarce; and (c) cookies scarce because of high demand were rated higher than cookies that were scarce because of an accident. With regard to abundance, cookies that were constantly abundant were rated higher than cookies that began scarce but later became abundant. Results extend commodity theory. Reactance was hypothesized as an intervening process responsible for some of the results. The 2nd study was performed to rule out the possibility that demand characteristics were responsible for the obtained results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Seeking to achieve a more realistic simulation of actual courtroom practice than that produced in prior studies, which have relied exclusively on short written synopses as their method of trial presentation, this experiment tested the hypothesis that physical attractiveness would have a significant impact on juridic judgments even though the audiovisual presentation of the trial permitted the introduction of a variety of the important stimuli typically present at a jury trial.  This prediction received empirical support:  Subjects exposed to an attractive plaintiff and an unattractive defendant more often found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded more money in damages than students viewing an unattractive plaintiff and an attractive defendant.  However in contrast to findings from general studies of interpersonal evaluation, analyses of student perceptions of the two litigants provided only limited evidence for a global (positive) physical attractiveness stereotype within the context of a simulated trial.  Instead, the observed effect of physical attractiveness on student decisions was apparently mediated by differential perceptions of the seriousness of the accident itself.  Possible implications of the results for the judicial process were mentioned.},

abstract = {In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-min testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the ANT produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The ANT may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, OBJECTIVES: To compare
changes in shoulder internal rotation range of motion (ROM), for
2 stretching exercises, the "cross-body stretch" and the "sleeper
stretch," in individuals with posterior shoulder tightness. BACKGROUND:
Recently, some authors have expressed the belief that the sleeper
stretch is better than the cross-body stretch to address glenohumeral
posterior tightness because the scapula is stabilized. METHODS: Fifty-four
asymptomatic subjects (20 males, 34 females) participated in the
study. The control group (n=24) consisted of subjects with a between-shoulder
difference in internal rotation ROM of less than 10 degrees, whereas
those subjects with more than a 10 degrees difference were randomly
assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups, the sleeper stretch group
(n=15) or the cross-body stretch group (n=15). Shoulder internal
rotation ROM, with the arm abducted to 90 degrees and scapula motion
prevented, was measured before and after a 4-week intervention period.
Subjects in the control group were asked not to engage in any new
stretching activities, while subjects in the 2 stretching groups
were asked to perform stretching exercises on the more limited side
only, once daily for 5 repetitions, holding each stretch for 30 seconds.
RESULTS: The improvements in internal rotation ROM for the subjects
in the cross-body stretch group (mean +/- SD, 20.0 degrees +/- 12.9
degrees) were significantly greater than for the subjects in the
control group (5.9 degrees +/- 9.4 degrees, P = .009). The gains
in the sleeper stretch group (12.4 degrees +/- 10.4 degrees) were
not significant compared to those of the control group (P = .586)
and those of the cross-body stretch group (P = .148). CONCLUSIONS:
The cross-body stretch in individuals with limited shoulder internal
rotation ROM appears to be more effective than no stretching in controls
without internal rotation asymmetry to improve shoulder internal
rotation ROM. While the improvement in internal rotation from the
cross-body stretch was greater than for the sleeper stretch and of
a magnitude that could be clinically significant, the small sample
size likely precluded statistical significance between groups.},

It is stated that, overall, evidence supports the view that heuristic modes of thinking, and their attendant biases, are important features of strategic decision-making. The findings reviewed demonstrate that behavioral decision research can make an important contribution to the understanding of strategic management by identifying and explaining fundamental limitations of strategic thinking and reasoning, thereby adding to a growing body of psychological research concerned with the nature and impact of cognition and emotion in strategic management.

abstract = {Rating scales are employed as a means of extracting more information out of an item than would be obtained from a mere “yes/no”, “right/wrong” or other dichotomy. But does this additional information increase measurement accuracy and precision? Eight guidelines are suggested to aid the analyst in optimizing the manner in which rating scales categories cooperate in order to improve the utility of the resultant measures. Though these guidelines are presented within the context of Rasch analysis, they reflect aspects of rating scale functioning which impact all methods of analysis. The guidelines feature rating-scale-based data such as category frequency, ordering, rating-to-measure inferential coherence, and the quality of the scale from measurement and statistical perspectives. The manner in which the guidelines prompt recategorization or reconceptualization of the rating scale is indicated. Utilization of the guidelines is illustrated through their application to two published data sets.},

abstract = {Emotional and neutral sounds rated for valence and arousal were used to investigate the influence of emotions on timing in reproduction and verbal estimation tasks with durations from 2 s to 6 s. Results revealed an effect of emotion on temporal judgment, with emotional stimuli judged to be longer than neutral ones for a similar arousal level. Within scalar expectancy theory (J. Gibbon, R. Church, & W. Meck, 1984), this suggests that emotion-induced activation generates an increase in pacemaker rate, leading to a longer perceived duration. A further exploration of self-assessed emotional dimensions showed an effect of valence and arousal. Negative sounds were judged to be longer than positive ones, indicating that negative stimuli generate a greater increase of activation. High-arousing stimuli were perceived to be shorter than low-arousing ones. Consistent with attentional models of timing, this seems to reflect a decrease of attention devoted to time, leading to a shorter perceived duration. These effects, robust across the 2 tasks, are limited to short intervals and overall suggest that both activation and attentional processes modulate the timing of emotional events.},

abstract = {Social media have been adopted by many businesses. More and more companies are using social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to provide various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of user-generated content is freely available on social media sites. To increase competitive advantage and effectively assess the competitive environment of businesses, companies need to monitor and analyze not only the customer-generated content on their own social media sites, but also the textual information on their competitors' social media sites. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge for decision makers and e-marketers, this paper describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyze unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Papa John's Pizza. The results reveal the value of social media competitive analysis and the power of text mining as an effective technique to extract business value from the vast amount of available social media data. Recommendations are also provided to help companies develop their social media competitive analysis strategy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Contemporary commentators have attributed these scandals to the financial sector's business culture8-10, but no scientific evidence supports this claim. Here we show that employees of a large, international bank behave, on average, honestly in a control condition. However, when their professional identity as bank employees is rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become dishonest. This effect is specific to bank employees because control experiments with employees from other industries and with students showthat they do not becomemore dishonestwhen theirprofessional identity or bank-related items are rendered salient. Our results thus suggest that the prevailing business culture in the banking industry weakens and undermines the honesty norm, implying that measures to re-establish an honest culture are very important.},

Undergraduate students (n = 357) completed questionnaires regarding (a) bipolar spectrum disorders [the General Behavior Inventory (GBI), a well-established clinical screening measure], (b) current depression and mania symptoms (the Internal State Scale; ISS), and (c) BIS/BAS sensitivities (the BIS/BAS scales). Validated cutoff scores on the GBI were used to identify individuals at risk for a mood disorder. It was hypothesized that, among at-risk respondents, high BAS and low BIS levels would be associated with high current mania ratings, whereas low BAS and high BIS would be associated with high current depression ratings. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, among at-risk individuals (n = 63), BAS accounted for 27% of current mania symptoms but BIS did not contribute. For these individuals, BAS and BIS were both significant and together accounted for 44% of current depressive symptoms.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND The "Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Rheumatoid Arthritis
(RA)" is an application of the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) and represents the typical spectrum of
problems in functioning of patients with RA. OBJECTIVES The objective
of this study was to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective
of nurses. METHOD Nurses experienced in RA treatment were asked about
the patients' problems, patients' resources and aspects of environment
that nurses take care of in a three-round survey using the Delphi
technique. Responses were linked to the ICF. RESULTS 57 nurses in
15 countries named 1170 concepts that covered all ICF components.
20 concepts were linked to the as yet undeveloped ICF component Personal
Factors. 19 ICF categories are not represented in the Comprehensive
ICF Core Set for RA. CONCLUSION The validity of the Comprehensive
ICF Core Set for RA was largely supported by the nurses. However,
a number of body functions which address side effects of drug therapies
were not included in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for RA. Furthermore,
several issues arose which were not precisely covered by the ICF
like "dry mucous", "risk for decubitus ulcers" and "height" and need
to be investigated further.},

abstract = {The topic of environmental sustainability is generating increased concern among business ex- ecutives, governments, consumers, and management scholars. As these stakeholders struggle with the challenges and opportunities presented by an array of environmental issues, HRM scholars and practitioners alike have been relatively slow to engage in the ongoing discussions and debates. Through this special issue on Green HRM, we seek to stimulate the field of HRM to expand its role in the pursuit of environmentally sustainable business. In this introduction to the special issue, we first provide an overview of the articles that appear in the special issue. Next we present a detailed discussion of research questions that arise from a consideration of several functional HRM practices, including performance management; training, development, and learning; compensation and rewards; and organizational culture. We conclude by describ- ing opportunities for research at the intersection of strategic HRM and environmental man- agement. If pursued with vigor, research addressing this extensive agenda could begin to estab- lish a healthy field of Green HRM scholarship},

revealed that the relation between authenticity and verbal defensiveness
was indirect, mediated by mindfulness. These findings support the
view that higher authenticity and mindfulness relate to greater tendencies
to engage self-relevant information in a relatively non-defensive

abstract = {Abstract The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of implementing a new 8-week mindfulness-based programme, ‘Mindfulness-Based Coping with University Life' (MBCUL), specifically tailored to the needs and demand of students and to explore its impact in a pilot evaluation. Participants were drawn from the University of Northampton (MBCUL N = 10; control N = 6). A non-randomized wait-list-controlled design was employed. Measures examined anxiety and depression, perceived stress, mindfulness and personally relevant change before and immediately after the programme. The diurnal profile of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase level was collected for two consecutive days. No significant intergroup differences were observed on any of the measures at either time point. However, significant change was observed for the MBCUL group in terms of perceived stress (d = 1.06; z = −2.25, p = 0.03), anxiety (d = 1.04; z = −2.14, p = 0.03), depression (d = 0.52; z = −0.69, p = 0.5) and personally relevant change (d = 2.63; z = −2.68, p = 0.01), along with an increase in mindfulness (d = 1.06; z = −1.89, p = 0.06). In contrast, no significant change was found in the daily profiles of cortisol and alpha-amylase. The data from this pilot tentatively suggest that MBCUL appears to be a promising programme that warrants further evaluation using a randomized study with a larger sample size.

abstract = {Reporting p values from statistical significance tests is common in psychology's empirical literature. Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an 'objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0. This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To operationalize items based on categories of the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) relevant
to patient problems that are addressed by physiotherapeutic interventions
in the acute hospital, and to test the reliability of these items
when applied by physiotherapists. METHODS A selection of 124 ICF
categories was operation-alized in a formal decision-making and consensus
process. The reliability of the newly operationalized item list was
tested with a cross-sectional study with repeated measurements. RESULTS
The item writing process resulted in 94 dichotomous and 30 polytomous
items. Data were collected in a convenience sample of 28 patients
with neurological, musculoske-letal, cardiopulmonary, or internal
organ conditions, requiring physical therapy in an acute hospital.
Fifty-six percent of the polytomous and 68% of the dichotomous items
had a raw agreement of 0.7 or above, whereas 36% of all polytomous
and 34% of all dichotomous items had a kappa coefficient of 0.7 and
above. CONCLUSION The study supports that the ICF is adaptable to
professional and setting-specific needs of physiotherapists. Further
research towards the development of reliable instruments for physiotherapists
based on the ICF seems justified. :},

abstract = {The Sexual Experiences Survey (Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987) is
a commonly used instrument for assessing various degrees of sexual
aggression and victimization among male offenders and female victims.
Rasch analysis was used to transform qualitative raw score observations
into objective linear measures using the responses of a national
sample of 6,159 higher education men and women across the United
States, aged 18-24. This paper supports the construct validity of
the survey through evaluation of the item hierarchy, fit statistics,
and separation indices. Findings confirm a "dimensional" perspective
on rape, suggesting that sexually aggressive behaviors can be scaled
along a single continuum from normal to extreme sexual behavior.
The item hierarchy reveals an arrangement of sexually aggressive
acts in an order of mild to severe, which compares with the one theorized
by the authors of the SES. Identity plots demonstrate the validity
of using a common set of SES item calibrations to measure both male
and female respondents. For interpretation of person responses to
the SES, three conclusions are suggested. First, Rasch analysis must
be employed to examine item responses effectively. Second, when the
survey is administered to a college sample aged 18-24, the item calibrations
obtained in this paper can be used to measure offenders and victims.
Third, a total raw score-to-measure conversion is not always sufficient
to interpret person measures. Instead, a scalogram method needs be
added to the Rasch analysis to separate the measures of offenders
and victims who complete the survey. Implications for future research
are discussed.},

The objective of this article was to fill this gap by providing initial validation evidence of the German Inpatient Satisfaction Scale as an instrument for German-speaking countries. We performed an exploratory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling in a cross-sectional design. The instrument was administered to N = 116,325 patients in hospitals in German-speaking countries. The overall response rates ranged from 63% to 98%. We found that a four-factor solution fit the data well. The four factors represented satisfaction with doctors{\textquoteright} care, nursing care, service facilities, and secondary care facilities. Cronbach{\textquoteright}s alpha ranged from .72 to .90. The findings may be of practical interest for health care providers for measuring patient satisfaction.},

Overall, results indicated a peak in prejudice in middle childhood (5-7 years) followed by a slight decrease until late childhood (8-10 years). In addition to differences for the various operationalizations of prejudice, detailed findings revealed different age-related changes in prejudice toward higher versus lower status out-groups and positive effects of contact opportunities with the out-group on prejudice development. Results confirm that prejudice changes systematically with age during childhood but that no developmental trend is found in adolescence, indicating the stronger influence of the social context on prejudice with increasing age.},

Two well-known methods are boosting (see, e.g., Shapire et al., 1998) and bagging Breiman (1996) of classification trees. In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction. In bagging, successive trees do not depend on earlier trees — each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set. In the end, a simple majority vote is taken for prediction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to adapt and validate an instrument for assessing quality of care from the patients' perspective in the context of Chilean primary care. METHODS: The 'Health Centre Assessment Questionnaire' is made up of six multiple-item scales and two single-item scales addressing eight key areas of primary care activity. A further two single-item scales ask about the overall satisfaction and the way in which the centre deals with patients' health issues. The adaptation process was developed according to methods described in the specialized literature. The instrument was initially pre-tested in a sample of 100 primary care patients. The validation was carried out in 10 urban public primary healthcare centres where 2896 patients were invited to complete the questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the instrument was assessed using standard psychometric techniques. RESULTS: Ninety nine per cent (2870) of those approached completed the questionnaire. It was acceptable to most of the patients as reflected by the high response rate, and a full range of possible scores in most of the scales. Reliability was good as reflected by high internal consistency and homogeneity. Validity was supported by the confirmation of scaling assumptions, the moderate correlations between multiple-item scales, and by the confirmation of our 'a priori' hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire could be a useful instrument for assessing a number of important dimensions in Chilean primary care. It is acceptable, reliable and valid. Further work is required to evaluate its validity against external criteria and its test-retest reliability.},

In the adult sample, belief in a just world covaried with gender, age, origin (East-Germany, West-Germany), marital status, education, and employment. Origin and education had the largest effects. Therefore, origin- and education specific norms were determined in addition to general norms. Age and gender differences were small in the student sample.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously studied prospective associations between computer use and mental health symptoms in a selected young adult population. The purpose of this study was to investigate if high computer use is a prospective risk factor for developing mental health symptoms in a population-based sample of young adults.

METHODS: The study group was a cohort of young adults (n = 4163), 20-24 years old, who responded to a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Exposure variables included time spent on computer use (CU) in general, email/chat use, computer gaming, CU without breaks, and CU at night causing lost sleep. Mental health outcomes included perceived stress, sleep disturbances, symptoms of depression, and reduced performance due to stress, depressed mood, or tiredness. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated for prospective associations between exposure variables at baseline and mental health outcomes (new cases) at 1-year follow-up for the men and women separately.

RESULTS: Both high and medium computer use compared to low computer use at baseline were associated with sleep disturbances in the men at follow-up. High email/chat use was negatively associated with perceived stress, but positively associated with reported sleep disturbances for the men. For the women, high email/chat use was (positively) associated with several mental health outcomes, while medium computer gaming was associated with symptoms of depression, and CU without breaks with most mental health outcomes. CU causing lost sleep was associated with mental health outcomes for both men and women.

CONCLUSIONS: Time spent on general computer use was prospectively associated with sleep disturbances and reduced performance for the men. For the women, using the computer without breaks was a risk factor for several mental health outcomes. Some associations were enhanced in interaction with mobile phone use. Using the computer at night and consequently losing sleep was associated with most mental health outcomes for both men and women. Further studies should focus on mechanisms relating information and communication technology (ICT) use to sleep disturbances.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to test whether Gray's " Behavioural Inhibition System" (BIS) is a pathway from mindfulness towards well-being in a cross-sectional and correlational design, using online data collection. We administered the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) to a non-clinical sample of German adults (n= 211). BIS was measured using the Action Regulation Emotion System Questionnaire (ARES), and well-being was measured using a compound variable consisting of the Marburg Habitual Well-being Scale (MHW) along with two subscales of the Questionnaire of General Habitual Well-Being (FAHW). We analysed two mediator models with the FMI or KIMS as independent variables, respectively. In both models, BIS was modelled as a mediator, and well-being served as the dependent variable. The total effect of mindfulness on well-being was found to be strong for both models. Also, the effect of mindfulness on the proposed mediator BIS was substantial, as was the effect of BIS on well-being. The study demonstrates that BIS can partially explain the pathway between mindfulness and well-being, suggesting that BIS may be a mediator of the effects of mindfulness. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nursing diagnoses represent individual reactions to existing or potential
changes in one's state of health. They are result of a diagnostic
process, which is part of the dynamic nursing care process in its
whole. Thus, as a basis of nursing interventions diagnoses have to
be proved continuously. The classification of the North American
Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) as well as the International
Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) can be account to the
international well-known classifications of nursing diagnoses. Comparing
their structures, some fundamental differences between both classifications
become obvious. While the NANDA classification represents a systematic
structured body of nursing knowledge with regard to human health
reactions patterns, the ICNP reflects a more comprehensive part of
the nursing reality, since it also contains nursing interventions
and outcomes. Until the latest changes by establishing the taxonomy
II, NANDA diagnoses have primarily focused deficits. But in contrast
to the diagnoses of the ICNP they also comprise etiological factors.
To prove the applicability of both classifications to nursing practice,
they have been applied to a case study of a female resident living
in a nursing home. The results of analysis show that because of their
different structures the NANDA classification and ICNP have their
own possibilities and limitations in covering the resident's individual
needs of nursing care. These characteristic potentials and restrictions
have to be taken into account when one of the classification systems
is going to be implemented into nursing practice.},

abstract = {Mindfulness meditation training has stress reduction benefits in various
patient populations, but its effects on biological markers of HIV-1
progression are unknown. The present study tested the efficacy of
an 8-week Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) meditation program
compared to a 1-day control seminar on CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in
stressed HIV infected adults. A single-blind randomized controlled
trial was conducted with enrollment and follow-up occurring between
November 2005 and December 2007. A diverse community sample of 48
HIV-1 infected adults was randomized and entered treatment in either
an 8-week MBSR or a 1-day control stress reduction education seminar.
The primary outcome was circulating counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes.
Participants in the 1-day control seminar showed declines in CD4+
T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among participants in the 8-week
MBSR program were unchanged from baseline to post-intervention (time × treatment
condition interaction, p = .02). This effect was independent of
antiretroviral (ARV) medication use. Additional analyses indicated
that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as
measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness
meditation training on buffering CD4+ T lymphocyte declines. These
findings provide an initial indication that mindfulness meditation
training can buffer CD4+ T lymphocyte declines in HIV-1 infected
adults. Clinical Trials Registration: clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier:

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical literature cautions against use of meditation by people with psychosis. There is, however, evidence for acceptance-based therapy reducing relapse, and some evidence for clinical benefits of mindfulness groups for people with distressing psychosis, though no data on whether participants became more mindful. AIMS: To assess feasibility of randomized evaluation of group mindfulness therapy for psychosis, to replicate clinical gains observed in one small uncontrolled study, and to assess for changes in mindfulness. METHOD: Twenty-two participants with current distressing psychotic experiences were allocated at random between group-based mindfulness training and a waiting list for this therapy. Mindfulness training comprised twice-weekly sessions for 5 weeks, plus home practice (meditation CDs were supplied), followed by 5 weeks of home practice. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between intervention and waiting-list participants. Secondary analyses combining both groups and comparing scores before and after mindfulness training revealed significant improvement in clinical functioning (p = .013) and mindfulness of distressing thoughts and images (p = .037). CONCLUSIONS: Findings on feasibility are encouraging and secondary analyses replicated earlier clinical benefits and showed improved mindfulness of thoughts and images, but not voices.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate pain perception and the potential analgesic
effects of mindful states in experienced Zen meditators.Methods:
Highly trained Zen meditators (n = 13; >1000 hours of practice) and
age/gender-matched control volunteers (n = 13) received individually
adjusted thermal stimuli to elicit moderate pain on the calf. Conditions
included: a) baseline-1: no task; b) concentration: attend exclusively
to the calf; c) mindfulness: attend to the calf and observe, moment
to moment, in a nonjudgmental manner; and d) baseline-2: no task.Results:
Meditators required significantly higher temperatures to elicit moderate
pain (meditators: 49.9°C; controls: 48.2°C; p = .01). While attending
“mindfully,��? meditators reported decreases in pain intensity
whereas control subjects showed no change from baseline. The concentration
condition resulted in increased pain intensity for controls but not
for meditators. Changes in pain unpleasantness generally paralleled
those found in pain intensity. In meditators, pain modulation correlated
with slowing of the respiratory rate and with greater meditation
experience. Covariance analyses indicated that mindfulness-related
changes could be partially explained by changes in respiratory rates.
Finally, the meditators reported higher tendencies to observe and
be nonreactive of their own experience as measured on the Five Factor
Mindfulness Questionnaire; these factors correlated with individual
differences in respiration.Conclusions: These results indicated that
Zen meditators have lower pain sensitivity and experience analgesic
effects during mindful states. Results may reflect cognitive/self-regulatory
skills related to the concept of mindfulness and/or altered respiratory
patterns. Prospective studies investigating the effects of meditative
training and respiration on pain regulation are warranted.},

abstract = {Reducing the number of items in a health-related quality of life instrument
will enhance efficiency. However, it is important to maintain measurement
properties. We determined the effect of reducing items from each
domain (dyspnea, fatigue, emotion and mastery) of the 20-item Chronic
Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). Three randomized trials of respiratory
rehabilitation provided data. We removed items one at a time from
each domain in three orders: by item impact, item responsiveness,
and at random. Responsiveness, test-retest reliability and construct
validity were evaluated at each step. Responsiveness and reliability,
evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), were reduced
marginally as the number of items was reduced to two items per domain.
The deterioration was greatest when reducing from two items to one.
To detect a particular effect, sample size would increase by about
10% when reducing the number of items in a domain to 2. Construct
validity showed a more marked deterioration. Reducing to two items
per domain would maintain responsiveness and reliability of the CRQ
at an acceptable level, with a trade-off of reduced construct validity
and increase in sample size requirements.},

abstract = {Diagnostische Zielsetzung:Bei den Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) handelt es sich um ein haeufig eingesetztes und bewaehrtes Verfahren zur Messung des sprachunabhaengigen logischen Denkens. Die APM gehoeren zur Verfahrensgruppe der Raven-Matrizen-Tests (RPM) und stellen in diesem Rahmen eine Version fuer ein ueberdurchschnittliches kognitives Leistungsniveau dar. Durch den Einsatz eines Zeitlimits kann die intellektuelle Effizienz der Probanden beurteilt werden.Aufbau:Die APM-Items bestehen aus geometrischen Figuren bzw. Mustern, in denen je ein Element ausgelassen wurde. Aus acht Antwortalternativen ist diejenige zu waehlen, die das Muster korrekt ergaenzt. Die Aufgaben sind nach Schwierigkeitsgrad geordnet und in zwei separaten Aufgabenheften zu den Aufgabensets 1 und 2 zusammengefasst. Das erste Set umfasst 12 Aufgaben (APM I), das zweite 36 Aufgaben (APM II). APM I wird entweder zur Vorbereitung des Einsatzes von APM II oder als Screeninginstrument eingesetzt. APM II ist lediglich bei Personen mit hinreichend hohem intellektuellen Leistungsniveau einzusetzen, um unnoetige Frustrationen zu vermeiden. Die gewaehlte Antwortalternative ist auf einem Durchschreibebogen bzw. in der computerisierten Version auf dem Monitor anzukreuzen.Grundlagen und Konstruktion:Die APM wurden 1943 zur Personalauslese im militaerischen Bereich eingesetzt und 1947 fuer den allgemeinen Gebrauch veroeffentlicht. Basierend auf Analysen der Aufgabenschwierigkeit wurden die Items nach ansteigender Schwierigkeit geordnet. Eine erste Revision der APM und eine Reduktion der urspruenglich 48 Items auf 36 Items (APM II) erfolgten 1962. In den aktuellen Auflagen des Verfahrens wurden die Items und ihre Reihenfolge nicht mehr modifiziert. Die mit den RPM gemessene Faehigkeit, Beziehungen zu stiften, wird von Raven als Faehigkeit beschrieben, aus vorgegebenen Informationen ein neues Verstaendnis bzw. neue Informationen abzuleiten.Empirische Pr{\"{u}}fung und G{\"{u}}tekriterien:Aktuelle Manuale fuer die APM liegen von Raven et al. (1998b) sowie Heller et al. (1998) vor. Beide Manuale zitieren zahlreiche Studien, die mit den APM und den RPM als Verfahrensgruppe durchgefuehrt worden sind.Reliabilit{\"{a}}t: Die Reliabilitaetskoeffizienten fuer APM I fallen deutlich niedriger aus als fuer APM II. Als Masse der internen Konsistenz ermittelten Raven et al. (1998b, S. 24) fuer die APM II Split-half-Reliabilitaetskoeffizienten zwischen .83 und .87, fuer APM I Werte um .73. Heller et al. (1998, S. 12) ermittelten Alphawerte zwischen .34 und .78 (APM I) sowie zwischen .70 und .88 (APM II; Schueler der Klassen 6 bis 12). Nach einem Intervall von 3 Monaten ermittelten Heller et al. (1998, S. 13) an Schuelerstichproben Retestreliabilitaetskoeffizienten zwischen .58 und .82.Validit{\"{a}}t: Verwiesen wird auf signifikante Korrelationen zwischen APM und anderen Verfahren zur Messung intellektueller Faehigkeiten. Die Korrelationen mit sprachfreien Verfahren (z.B. Wechsler-Handlungs-IQ: r = .55) liegen ueber denen mit sprachbezogenen Verfahren (z.B. Wechsler-Verbal-IQ: r = .42; 131 Schueler). Korrelationen zwischen APM und den quantitativen und nonverbalen Skalen des Kognitiven Faehigkeitstests (.26 bis .44) bestaetigen insbesondere die Komponente des analogen Denkens in den APM (98 hochbegabte Schueler der 9./10. Klasse Gymnasium; 59 Schueler der 10. Klasse Regelgymnasium). Mit der beim Zahlenverbindungstest zentralen Komponente der Informationsverarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit weisen die APM zwar signifikante, aber nicht sehr hohe Zusammenhaenge von .34 (APM I) bzw. .33 (APM II) auf (114 Schueler der 8./9. Klasse). Mit den Mathematikschulnoten der 8. bzw. 9. Klasse (223 Schueler) bzw. den Deutschnoten wiesen die APM Korrelationen in Hoehe von .34 (APM I) und .35(APM II) bzw. .23 (APM I) und .27 (APM II) auf. Hinweise auf eine Geschlechtsabhaengigkeit der APM-Ergebnisse liegen nicht vor.Normen: Die deutschen Referenzwerte (Prozentraenge) von Raven et al. (1998b) basieren auf einer Stichprobe von 1142 Personen (48.5% weiblich, 51,5% maennlich; 13-75 Jahre). Ein vorhandenes Zeitlimit sowie unterschiedliche Bildungsniveaus und Berufsgruppen werden beruecksichtigt. Die Normen der APM-Ausgabe von Heller et al. (1998) beruhen auf einer deutschsprachigen Stichprobe von 581 Studierenden, 921 Schuelern und 157 Senioren ueber 60 Jahren. Ferner werden Daten von Normierungsstichproben aus Australien, China, Deutschland, Grossbritannien, Neuseeland, Nordirland, Polen sowie den USA aufgefuehrt.},

abstract = {Mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. This research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. The development and psychometric properties of the dispositional Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) are described. Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.},

abstract = {Extraversion has two central characteristics: (1) interpersonal engagement,
which consists of affiliation (enjoying and valuing close interpersonal
bonds, being warm and affectionate) and agency (being socially dominant,
enjoying leadership roles, being assertive, being exhibitionistic,
and having a sense of potency in accomplishing goals) and (2) impulsivity,
which emerges from the interaction of extraversion and a second,
independent trait (constraint). Agency is a more general motivational
disposition that includes dominance, ambition, mastery, efficacy,
and achievement. Positive affect (a combination of positive feelings
and motivation) is closely associated with extraversion. Extraversion
is accordingly based on positive incentive motivation. Parallels
between extraversion (particularly its agency component) and a mammalian
behavioral approach system based on positive incentive motivation
implicate a neuroanatomical network and modulatory neurotransmitters
in the processing of incentive motivation. A corticolimbic-striatal-thalamic
network (1) integrates the salient incentive context in the medial
orbital cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus; (2) encodes the intensity
of incentive stimuli in a motive circuit composed of the nucleus
accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area dopamine
projection system; and (3) creates an incentive motivational state
that can be transmitted to the motor system. Individual differences
in the functioning of this network arise from functional variation
in the ventral tegmental area dopamine projections, which are directly
involved in coding the intensity of incentive motivation. The animal
evidence suggests that there are three neurodevelopmental sources
of individual differences in dopamine: genetic, "experience-expectant,"
and "experience-dependent." Individual differences in dopamine promote
variation in the heterosynaptic plasticity that enhances the connection
between incentive context and incentive motivation and behavior.
Our psychobiological threshold model explains the effects of individual
differences in dopamine transmission on behavior, and their relation
to personality traits is discussed.},

abstract = {According to the realist interpretation, measurement commits us not just to the logically independent existence of things in space and time, but also to the existence of quantitatively structured properties and relations, and to the existence of real numbers, understood as relations of ratio between specific levels of such attributes. Measurement is defined as the estimation of numerical relations (or ratios) between magnitudes of a quantitative attribute and a unit. The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts. ¬{\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this article we review some generalizations of classical theories of measurement for concatenation (e.g., mass or length) and conjoint structures (e.g., momentum of mass-velocity pairs or loudness of intensity-frequency pairs). The earlier results on additive representations are briefly surveyed. Generalizations to nonadditive structures are outlined, and their more complex uniqueness results are described. The latter leads to a definition of scale type in terms of the symmetries (automorphisms) of the underlying qualitative structure. The major result is that for any measurement onto the real numbers, only three possible scale types exist that are both rich in symmetries but not too redundant: ratio, interval, and another lying between them. The possible numerical representations for concatenation structures corresponding to these scale types are completely described. The interval scale case leads to a generalization of subjective expected-utility theory that copes with some empirical violations of the classical theory. Partial attempts to axiomatize concatenation structures of these three scale types are described. Such structures are of interest because they make clear that there is a rich class of nonadditive concatenation and conjoint structures with representations of the same scale types as those used in physics.},

abstract = {Traditional Null Hypothesis Testing procedures are poorly adapted to theory testing. The methodology can mislead researchers in several ways, including: (a) a lack of power can result in an erroneous rejection of the theory; (b) the focus on directionality (ordinal tests) rather than more precise quantitative predictions limits the information gained; and (c) the misuse of probability values to indicate effect size. An alternative approach is proposed which involves employing the theory to generate explicit effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers from a large New England HMO system were used to test the model. There were a total of 15 predictions evaluated, each involving the relation between Stage of Change and one of the other 15 Transtheoretical Model variables. For each variable, omega-squared and the related confidence interval were calculated and compared to the predicted effect sizes. Eleven of the 15 predictions were confirmed, providing support for the theoretical model. Quantitative predictions represent a much more direct, informative, and strong test of a theory than the traditional test of significance.},

In four experiments using “door games,” we demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open, even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather than a desire for flexibility.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify specific patient satisfaction items related to overall satisfaction by different length of stay (LOS) for patients in Japanese hospital settings. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved a participant sample, drawn from 77 voluntarily participating hospitals throughout Japan, of in-patients discharged to the community. Older patients and psychiatric, pediatric, obstetric and gynecologic patients were excluded. The 1050 respondents analyzed (response rate > or = 5l.1%) were divided into three groups based on their LOS: group 1, LOS < or = 1 week; group 2, LOS < or = 1 month; and group 3, LOS > 1 month. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, we explored for each LOS group the relationship between overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction with 33 individual items, including three regarding perceived reputation of the hospital in question. RESULTS: Some unique satisfaction items for each group (e.g. 'skill of nursing care' in group 1, 'Recovery of physical health', 'skill of nursing care', and 'respect for patients opinions and feelings' in group 2, and 'relief from pain' and 'respect for patients' opinions and feelings' in group 3) were significantly associated with overall satisfaction. In all three groups, common items (e.g. 'recovery from distress and anxiety' and 'doctor's clinical competence') also related significantly to overall satisfaction. Two items pertaining to the hospital reputation dimension (e.g. 'family member's evaluation of the hospital' and 'hospital reputation among other patients') were also significant predictors of overall satisfaction in all three groups. CONCLUSION: The findings show that according to LOS, unique items could determine significantly the achievement of overall satisfaction, while some common predictors across all three LOS groupings also seemed to be indispensable for inpatient's assessment of hospital care. It was also confirmed in this study that a positive perception of hospital reputation might have an important role in patient satisfaction in Japan.},

25 women) over the age 60 (average age: 77 years). They suffered
from dementias of medium level (DSM III, Category 1, ICD No. 299),
and had been residents in an old age home longer than 3 months at
the start of the trial. The patients were treated first for 2 weeks
by placebo tablets and their initial performance was recorded during
this period by using the Nuremberg Gerontopsychological Inventory
(NAI). This was then followed by a treatment for 8 weeks with the
nootropic drug, centrophenoxine (CPH), the dose of which was 2 g/day
distributed in 2 x 2 tablets of Helfergin500 (Promonta, Hamburg,
FRG), or with placebo tablets of identical size, then the NAI test
was repeated again. Verum or placebo treatment was selected randomly
and the code was revealed only after having elaborated all the results
of the trial. During the treatment period four drop-outs occurred
for intercurrent diseases. Evaluation was based on a semi-quantitative,
intra-individual comparison of the performance before and after treatment.
The results obtained suggest that CPH treatment may be useful in
dementias of medium level in quite old groups of patients, since
48% of the verum group displayed improvements in the memory functions
against 28% of the placebo group. CPH seems to be a useful and harmless
drug in the treatment and most probably also in prevention of the
dementias.},

Therefore, an experiment was performed in a moving-base flight simulator to assess mediational (cognitive) workload measurement. Specifically, 16 workload estimation techniques were evaluated as to their sensitivity and intrusion in a flight task emphasizing mediational behavior. Task loading, using navigation problems presented on a display, was treated as an independent variable, and workload-measure values were treated as dependent variables. Results indicate that two mediational task measures, two rating scale measures, time estimation, and two eye behavior measures were reliably sensitive to mediational loading. The time estimation measure did, however, intrude on mediational task performance. Several of the remaining measures were completely insensitive to mediational load. },

abstract = {Based on the theory that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is maintained through a reactive and fused relationship with one's internal experiences and a tendency towards experiential avoidance and behavioral restriction, an acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) was developed to specifically target these elements. Since ABBT has been shown to be an efficacious treatment in previous studies, the current study focuses on proposed mechanisms of change over the course of therapy. Specifically, the current study focuses on session-by-session changes in two proposed mechanisms of change: acceptance of internal experiences and engagement in meaningful activities. Overall, clients receiving ABBT reported an increase in the amount of time spent accepting internal experiences and engaging in valued activities. Change in both acceptance and engagement in meaningful activities was related to responder status at post-treatment and change in these two proposed mechanisms predicted outcome above and beyond change in worry. In addition, change in acceptance was related to reported quality of life at post-treatment. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This book is intended as an upper level undergraduate or introductory graduate textbook in statistical thinking with a likelihood emphasis for students with a good knowledge of calculus and the ability to think abstractly. By “statistical thinking” is meant a focus on ideas that statisticians care about as opposed to technical details of how to put those ideas into practice. By “likelihood emphasis” is meant that the likelihood function and likelihood principle are unifying ideas throughout the text. Another unusual aspect is the use of statistical software as a pedagogical tool. That is, instead of viewing the computer merely as a convenient and accurate calculating device, we use computer calculation and simulation as another way of explaining and helping readers understand the underlying concepts. Our software of choice is R (R Development Core Team [2006]). R and accompanying manuals are available for free download from http://www.r-project.org. You may wish to download An Introduction to R to keep as a reference. It is highly recommended that you try all the examples in R. They will help you understand concepts, give you a little programming experience, and give you facility with a very flexible statistical software package. And don't just try the examples as written. Vary them a little; play around with them; experiment. You won't hurt anything and you'll learn a lot.},

@article{Wittmann2011b,
abstract = {It has been suggested that perception and action can be understood
as evolving in temporal epochs or sequential processing units. Successive
events are fused into units forming a unitary experience or ?psychological
present?. Studies have identified several temporal integration levels
on different time scales which are fundamental for our understanding
of behaviour and subjective experience. In recent literature concerning
the philosophy and neuroscience of consciousness these separate temporal
processing levels are not always precisely distinguished. Therefore,
empirical evidence from psychophysics and neuropsychology on these
distinct temporal processing levels is presented and discussed within
philosophical conceptualizations of time experience. On an elementary
level, one can identify a functional moment, a basic temporal building
block of perception in the range of milliseconds that defines simultaneity
and succession. Below a certain threshold temporal order is not perceived,
individual events are processed as co-temporal. On a second level,
an experienced moment, which is based on temporal integration of
up to a few seconds, has been reported in many qualitatively different
experiments in perception and action. It has been suggested that
this segmental processing mechanism creates temporal windows that
provide a logistical basis for conscious representation and the experience
of nowness. On a third level of integration, continuity of experience
is enabled by working-memory in the range of multiple seconds allowing
the maintenance of cognitive operations and emotional feelings, leading
to mental presence, a temporal window of an individual?s experienced
presence.},

represents the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis according to the International Classification
of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The objective of this
study was to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective of physicians.
METHODS Physicians experienced in rheumatoid arthritis treatment
were asked about the problems they commonly treat in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis in a 3-round survey using the Delphi technique.
Responses were linked to the ICF. RESULTS Seventy-nine physicians
in 41 countries named 512 patients' problems. Two hundred and 27
ICF categories were linked to these answers. Twenty-six ICF categories
were not represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for rheumatoid
arthritis and 19 aspects were not covered by the ICF. CONCLUSION
The content validity of 3 ICF components was well supported. However,
several body functions were identified that are not covered and need
to be investigated further.},

abstract = {Five days of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves attention and self-regulation in comparison with the same amount of relaxation training. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of IBMT and relaxation training. During and after training, the IBMT group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the IBMT group. Frontal midline ACC theta was correlated with high-frequency HRV, suggesting control by the ACC over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group shows better regulation of the ANS by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the IBMT but not in the control group. These results could be useful in the design of further specific interventions.},

Partially consistent with prediction, results indicated that, relative to negative and positive affectivity and emotional expression and processing associated with approach-oriented coping, mindfulness-based attention incrementally predicted anhedonic depressive, but not anxious arousal, symptoms. Additionally, consistent with prediction, mindfulness-based attention demonstrated incremental validity in relation to perceived health, and the degree of impairment of health in terms of physical and mental functioning.

abstract = {This study examined the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on the brain-behavior mechanisms of self-referential processing in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Sixteen patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while encoding self-referential, valence, and orthographic features of social trait adjectives. Post- MBSR, 14 patients completed neuroimaging. Compared to baseline, MBSR completers showed (a) increased self-esteem and decreased anxiety, (b) increased positive and decreased negative self-endorsement, (c) increased activity in a brain network related to attention regulation, and (d) reduced activity in brain systems implicated in conceptual-linguistic self-view. MBSR-related changes in maladaptive or distorted social self-view in adults diagnosed with SAD may be related to modulation of conceptual self-processing and attention regulation. Self-referential processing may serve as a functional biobehavioral target to measure the effects of mindfulness training.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examines differences in computer-related self-efficacy and anxiety in subgroups of older adults, and changes in those measures after exposure to a systematic training program and subsequent computer use.

METHODS: Participants were volunteers in the Intelligent Systems for Assessment of Aging Changes study (ISAAC) carried out by the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology. Participants were administered two questionnaires before training and again 1 year later, which were related to computer self-efficacy and anxiety. Continuous recording of computer use was also assessed for a subset of participants.

RESULTS: Baseline comparisons by sex, age, education, living arrangement, and computer proficiency, but not cognitive status, yielded significant differences in confidence and anxiety related to specific aspects of computer use. At 1-year follow-up, participants reported less anxiety and greater confidence. However, the benefits of training and exposure varied by group and task. Comparisons based on cognitive status showed that the cognitively intact participants benefited more from training and/or experience with computers than did participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who after 1 year continued to report less confidence and more anxiety regarding certain aspects of computer use.

CONCLUSION: After 1 year of consistent computer use, cognitively intact participants in this study reported reduced levels of anxiety and increased self-confidence in their ability to perform specific computer tasks. Participants with MCI at baseline were less likely to demonstrate increased efficacy or confidence than their cognitively intact counterparts.},

abstract = {Background: Slowing of motor movements in human aging is a well-known
occurrence, but its biologic basis is poorly understood. Reliable
quantitation may refine observations of this phenomenon to better
aid research on this entity.Methods: A panel equipped with timing
sensors under computer control was used to measure upper extremity
movement times in two groups of healthy individuals: adults younger
than 60 years of age (n = 56; range, 18–58 years) and adults older
than 60 years of age (n = 38; range, 61–94 years).Results: Fine
motor performance was better in the dominant hand (p = 0.0007) regardless
of age. Adult and aged groups differed on two basic timing measures,
which reflect coarse motor and fine motor performance (p < 0.0001).
There were no gender differences on either measure. There was a strong
effect of task difficulty with age on coarse motor (p < 0.01) and
fine motor (p < 0.0001) measures. The fine motor measure of hand
performance in healthy individuals correlated in a nonlinear fashion
with age for more difficult tasks (r2 = 0.63) but showed a simple
linear relation for less-demanding tasks (r2 = 0.5).Conclusion: This
technique sensitively detects age-related motor performance decline
in humans. There may be a critical period in late midlife when fine
motor performance decline either begins or abruptly worsens.},

Although WM capacity has been viewed as a constant trait, recent studies suggest that it can be improved by adaptive and extended training. This training is associated with changes in brain activity in frontal and parietal cortex and basal ganglia, as well as changes in dopamine receptor density. Transfer of the training effects to non-trained WM tasks is consistent with the notion of training-induced plasticity in a common neural network for WM. The observed training effects suggest that WM training could be used as a remediating intervention for individuals for whom low WM capacity is a limiting factor for academic performance or in everyday life. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Obwohl Messungen zur Arbeitszufriedenheit und -motivation gerne als interne Angelegenheit durchgef{\"{u}}hrt werden und die Messwerte auch h{\"{a}}ufigintern bleiben, k{\"{o}}nnen ver{\"{o}}ffentlichte Untersuchungen stellvertretend Aussagen zu Einstellungen zur Organisation, Arbeit und Arbeitsumfeld aufzeigen. Gutknecht (2005/06) befragte zwischen 2003 und 2005 knapp 400 Arbeitnehmende aus der IT-Branche und dem Berufsmilit{\"{a}}r bez{\"{u}}glich ihrer organisationsspezifi schen Einstellungen. Seine Ergebnisse beziehen sich besonders auf die Wahrnehmung von belastenden zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen in der Organisation. Gutknecht geht davon aus, dass diese Wahrnehmung sich indirekt negativ auf die Einstellung der Organisation gegen{\"{u}}ber auswirkt. Nachfolgend sind jene Ergebnisse dargestellt, die besonders deutlich hervorgetreten sind: • Das »Commitment« hat sich in allen Stichproben als der beste Pr{\"{a}}diktor hinsichtlich der K{\"{u}}ndigungsabsichten herausstellt. Als besonders relevant zur Vorhersage des »Commitments« bezeichnet Gutknecht die Kontextfaktoren: »W{\"{a}}hrend die Zufriedenheit mit den Kollegen, mit der Arbeitsplatzsicherheit und in geringerem Ausma{\ss} mit der H{\"{o}}he des Lohns verh{\"{a}}ltnism{\"{a}}{\ss}ig gro{\ss} ist, werden die Facetten Lohngerechtigkeit, Zukunftsaussichten und der F{\"{u}}hrungsstil in der Organisation weniger gut beurteilt«. • Der F{\"{u}}hrungsstil ist durchweg kritisch beurteilt worden – sowohl auf Stufe der Organisation wie auch in Bezug zu Chef-Mitarbeiter- Beziehungen. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die Beziehung zwischen Arbeitnehmenden und Vorgesetzten bedeutsam sein kann: »Unabh{\"{a}}ngig von Rang, Alter oder auch Arbeitszeit sind Personen, die von einer guten Beziehung zum Vorgesetzten berichten, allgemein zufriedener, resignieren weniger und generieren auch in unsicheren Zeiten weniger K{\"{u}}ndigungsabsichten. Zudem beurteilen sie das intrinsische Motivationspotenzial wie auch die Kontextfaktoren vorteilhafter, selbst wenn in vielen F{\"{a}}llen diese Aspekte vom direkten Vorgesetzten kaum aktiv beeinfl usst werden d{\"{u}}rften«. • Die Frage, ob »der direkte Vorgesetzte die Entwicklungsm{\"{o}}glichkeiten des Unterstellten erkennt«, verneinen viele der Befragten in beiden Stichproben. Dar{\"{u}}ber hinaus werden aber auch mangelnde Unterst{\"{u}}tzung, fehlender Respekt und mangelnde Fairness als Mangel in der Beziehung zum Vorgesetzten mitgeteilt.},

abstract = {As we begin the 21st century, the introductory statistics course appears healthy, with its emphasis on real examples, data production, and graphics for exploration and assumption-checking. Without doubt this emphasis marks a major improvement over introductory courses of the 1960s, an improvement made possible by the vaunted “computer revolution.” Nevertheless, I argue that despite broad acceptance and rapid growth in enrollments, the consensus curriculum is still an unwitting prisoner of history. What we teach is largely the technical machinery of numerical approximations based on the normal distribution and its many subsidiary cogs. This machinery was once necessary, because the conceptually simpler alternative based on permutations was computationally beyond our reach. Before computers statisticians had no choice. These days we have no excuse. Randomization-based inference makes a direct connection between data production and the logic of inference that deserves to be at the core of every introductory course. Technology allows us to do more with less: more ideas, less technique. We need to recognize that the computer revolution in statistics education is far from over.},

I focus on several areas where the application of informatics approaches has already paid large dividends, leading to advances including novel data- collection approaches, the adaptation of computational techniques and insights, the enhanced aggregation and organization of psychological data, large-scale data mining and synthesis, and improved research and publication practices. I argue that in the coming years, informatics approaches are likely to play the same instrumental role in shaping psychological research that they have already played in other fields, such as genetics and neuroscience},

abstract = {Background Changes in the cortisol awakening response (CAR) were studied
in women participating in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
program after completion of their medical treatment for breast cancer.Method
Thirty-three women completed questionnaires pre- and post-MBSR pertaining
to: stress, depressive symptomatology, and medical symptoms. The
CAR was assessed on 3 days pre- and 3 days post-MBSR as a biological
marker of stress.Results A significant effect on the CAR was found,
with cortisol levels showing a prolonged increase after awakening
at the post-MBSR assessment period. This was accompanied by significant
improvements in self-reported stress levels, depressive symptomatology,
and medical symptoms. Furthermore, the change in medical symptoms
was negatively correlated with the area under the curve (AUC) at
study onset (r = -.52, p < .002); i.e., the greater the AUC of
the CAR before MBSR, the greater the reduction in medical symptoms
after the program.Conclusions These results suggest the potential
usefulness of employing the CAR as a biological marker in women with
breast cancer participating in an MBSR program.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ageing is characterized by a number of physical changes
that contribute to a decline in the ability to perform daily tasks.
Stretching has been proposed to reduce hip flexion contracture and
increase hip and pelvis range of motion, thus improving gait performance.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a supervised
stretching program designed to improve the range of motion of the
lower limbs alters gait kinematics in older adults. METHODS: Twenty
healthy older adult women (65.9 +/- 4.2 years old and BMI 24.9 +/-
3.5) were divided into 2 groups. The experimental group undertook
12 sessions of stretching exercises, whereas the control group did
not engage in any physical activity. Gait performance was assessed
at the beginning of the experiment and after the 4-week intervention
period. RESULTS: Those in the experimental group showed increased
step length, higher velocity and reduced double support time after
training. In addition, participants involved in the stretching program
showed greater anterior and lateral pelvis tilt and also greater
rotation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we can suggest
that a supervised stretching program is effective to alter a number
of gait variables. Moreover, after the stretching protocol, aged
participants displayed gait parameters which were similar to those
reported in young healthy adults. Therefore, stretching can be used
as an effective means to improve range of motion and reverse some
age-related changes that influence gait performance.},

deal of attention. The majority of research has focused on clinical
studies to evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions.
This line of research has led to promising data suggesting mindfulness-based
interventions are effective for treatment of both psychological and
physical symptoms. However, an equally important direction for future
research is to investigate questions concerning mechanisms of action
underlying mindfulness-based interventions. This theoretical paper
proposes a model of mindfulness, in an effort to elucidate potential
mechanisms to explain how mindfulness affects positive change. Potential
implications and future directions for the empirical study of mechanisms

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine effects of hip and ankle stretching on gait
function of older people. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING:
Flexibility training was performed in participants' homes. Assessments
were performed in a biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Forty
healthy volunteers (mean age +/- SD, 72.1+/-4.7 y) randomized to
2 groups: intervention (n=20) and control (n=20). INTERVENTION: Intervention
participants performed an 8-week stretching program, and control
group participants maintained activity level for 8 weeks. One investigator
made weekly visits to instruct and monitor participants. MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were passive joint motion for
hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion and freely chosen gait speed.
Secondary outcome measures were gait parameters during freely chosen
gait speed and set gait speed walking (stride length, joint displacement).
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group
had increased combined hip and knee motion (P=.023), ankle motion
(P=.020), and freely chosen gait speed (P=.016). The intervention
group showed statistically nonsignificant trends of increased stride
length at freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed. CONCLUSIONS:
Findings suggest joint motion is a modifiable impairment that is
effectively targeted with flexibility training for older people.
Participants in the intervention group had improvements in joint
motion as well as increased freely chosen gait speed. Mechanisms
responsible for changes in freely chosen gait speed warrant further
investigation.},

role in the leadership process. More specifically, it is proposed
that emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage
moods and emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective
leadership in organizations. Four major aspects of emotional intelligence,
the appraisal and expression of emotion, the use of emotion to enhance
cognitive processes and decision making, knowledge about emotions,
and management of emotions, are described. Then, I propose how emotional
intelligence contributes to effective leadership by focusing on five
essential elements of leader effectiveness: development of collective
goals and objectives; instilling in others an appreciation of the
importance of work activities; generating and maintaining enthusiasm,
confidence, optimism, cooperation, and trust; encouraging flexibility
in decision making and change; and establishing and maintaining a

The possible mechanisms of action and active ingredients of psychotherapy in children and adolescents are discussed, with an emphasis on the above-noted domains. The adult psychotherapy literature strongly supports the central roles of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic empathy; this has been much less intensively explored in the child and adolescent psychotherapy literature. Similarly, there have been few studies examining the mediation of treatment effects by impact on specific domains. Ideally, treatment studies should gather data that can be informative about the impact of putative mediating and moderating psychosocial and biological variables on outcome and course. The results of such studies can aid further refinements in both theories of etiology and improvement in treatments for children and adolescents.},

For historical-systematic reasons his work is divided into a precritical period (until 1968), a critical-emancipatory period (1968-1972), a critical-conceptual period (1973-1983), and a subject-scientific period (1984-1995). Social movements and internal problems of traditional psychology are identified as factors in the rise of his psychology, whereas the decline of Critical Psychology in the 1980s and 1990s is attributed to social development, limitations of a systematic-foundational framework, and the emergence of alternative critical approaches.

abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the repeatability of pupil responses to colored light stimuli in healthy subjects using a prototype chromatic pupillometer. One eye of 10 healthy subjects was tested twice in the same day using monochromatic light exposure at two selected wavelengths (660 and 470 nm, intensity 300 cd/m2) presented continuously for 20 s. Pupil responses were recorded in real-time before, during, and after light exposure. Maximal contraction amplitude and sustained contraction amplitude were calculated. In addition, we quantified the summed pupil response during continuous light stimulation as the total area between a reference line representing baseline pupil size and the line representing actual pupil size over 20 s (area under the curve). There was no significant difference in the repeated measure compared to the first test for any of the pupil response parameters. In conclusion, we have developed a novel prototype of color pupillometer which demonstrates good repeatability in evoking and recording the pupillary response to a bright blue and red light stimulus.},

T ogether, we explored the psychology of intuitive beliefs and choices and ex- amined their bounded rationality. This essay presents a current perspective on the three major topics of our joint work: heuristics of judgment, risky choice, and framing effects. In all three domains we studied intuitions – thoughts and preferences that come to mind quickly and without much re- flection. I review the older research and some recent developments in light of two ideas that have become central to social-cognitive psychology in the in- tervening decades: the notion that thoughts differ in a dimension of accessi- bility – some come to mind much more easily than others – and the distinc- tion between intuitive and deliberate thought processes.},

(2010). Within this past year, the ASA has issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines for undergraduate programs (ASA 2014). Accepting (and applauding) all this as background, the current article argues the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman (2001) call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular, following Brown and Kass, we should put priority on two goals, to make fundamental concepts accessible and to minimize prerequisites to research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relationship between patient satisfaction and background factors such as age, gender, health status and pain. In addition, to use background factors to create less biased ranking in comparisons of patient satisfaction between medical specialities. DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent by post to patients who had recently received inpatient care at a hospital within the County of Osterg{\"{o}}tland, Sweden. The questionnaire contained 33 questions, 21 of which concerned the quality of health care and patient satisfaction. SETTING: Inpatient departments at all four hospitals in the County of Osterg{\"{o}}tland, Sweden. SUBJECTS: All patients discharged from the hospital during a period of 6 weeks. Approximately 3400 patients aged 1-94 years responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 69%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient satisfaction index score (PSI). RESULTS: Of the background factors tested, patient age had the greatest explanatory value regarding the PSI, closely followed by experiencing anxiety during admission. With regard to variations in the PSI, about 20% could be explained by the background factors taken as a whole. Gender did not correlate with the PSI, although males were somewhat more satisfied than females. PSI scores differed among medical specialities and, interestingly, when age and other background factors were controlled for, the picture changed regarding the medical speciality that received the best PSI score. CONCLUSION: The change in ranking among medical specialities after adjustment for background factors emphasizes the importance of including background factors in patient satisfaction analyses in order to obtain less biased comparisons.},

The study spanned a 4-yr period, focusing on 1 semester per academic year in which half the population of 10,000 elementary school students received DARE and the other half did not. The questionnaire consisted of Likert-type items using a 5-point response scale that expressed an opinion toward the self, resistance to peer pressure, bonding with institutions such as family, education, and the law, and attitudes towards the use of drugs. Results indicate that DARE participation resulted in greater self-esteem, stronger institutional bonds, and endorsement of fewer risky behaviors.

abstract = {Working memory is crucial for many higher-level cognitive functions, ranging from mental arithmetic to reasoning and problem solving. Likewise, the ability to learn and categorize novel concepts forms an indispensable part of human cognition. However, very little is known about the relationship between working memory and categorization, and modeling in category learning has thus far been largely uninformed by knowledge about people's memory processes. This article reports a large study (N = 113) that related people's working memory capacity (WMC) to their category-learning performance using the 6 problem types of Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961). Structural equation modeling revealed a strong relationship between WMC and category learning, with a single latent variable accommodating performance on all 6 problems. A model of categorization (ALCOVE) was fit to the individual data and a single latent variable was sufficient to capture the variation among associative learning parameters across all problems. The data and modeling suggest that working memory mediates category learning across a broad range of tasks.},

Focusing Ss on the injunctive norm suppressed littering regardless of whether the environment was clean or littered (Study 1) and regardless of whether the environment in which Ss could litter was the same as or different from that in which the norm was evoked (Studies 2 and 3). The impact of focusing Ss on the descriptive norm was much less general.

abstract = {In the present study, we investigated the relation between cognitive performance and heart rate variability as a function of fitness level. We measured the effect of three cognitive tasks (the psychomotor vigilance task, a temporal orienting task, and a duration discrimination task) on the heart rate variability of two groups of participants: a high-fit group and a low-fit group. Two major novel findings emerged from this study. First, the lowest values of heart rate variability were found during performance of the duration discrimination task, compared to the other two tasks. Second, the results showed a decrement in heart rate variability as a function of the time on task, although only in the low-fit group. Moreover, the high-fit group showed overall faster reaction times than the low-fit group in the psychomotor vigilance task, while there were not significant differences in performance between the two groups of participants in the other two cognitive tasks. In sum, our results highlighted the influence of cognitive processing on heart rate variability. Importantly, both behavioral and physiological results suggested that the main benefit obtained as a result of fitness level appeared to be associated with processes involving sustained attention.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the "hardness" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a "positive" (full or partial) or "negative" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in "softer" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

abstract = {Langer's theory of mindfulness proposes that a mindful person seeks
out and produces novelty, is attentive to context, and is flexible
in thought and behavior. In three independent studies, the factor
structure of the Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale was examined.
Confirmatory factor analysis failed to replicate the four-factor
model and a subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence
of a two-factor (mindfulness and mindlessness) solution. Study 2
demonstrated that the two factors assessed discrete constructs and
were not merely products of acquiescence. Support was also found
for a nine-item, one-factor model comprised solely of mindfulness
items. On comparing models, Study 3 suggested the superiority of
the one-factor mindfulness model. Finally, a preliminary investigation
of the concurrent validity of the revised nine-item Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness
Scale is presented. The current article offers researchers a revised
version of a mindfulness measure derived from a cognitive perspective.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies in different clinical settings have established heart rate variability (HRV) as a significant independent risk factor for higher mortality and cardiac death. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of chronic haemodialysis therapy on time- and frequency-domain parameters of HRV in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We studied 25 patients with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (CKD4+DM), 25 patients with stage 4 CKD without diabetes (CKD4), 25 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and 25 healthy subjects (HS). The study was performed in two phases. In the first phase, a 24-h Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed in all subjects. The patients with stage 4 CKD were followed up until they progressed to stage 5, and in the second phase of the study, they underwent a 24-h Holter ECG monitoring after completion of 3 months of conventional haemodialysis treatment. RESULTS: In the first phase of the study, a reduction in cardiac sympathetic activity in CKD4 patients (significantly lower SDNN, SDANN/5 min, SD and VLF vs. HS) and worse autonomic function in CKD4+DM patients (significantly lower SDNN, SDANN/5 min, SD, VLF and LF/HF) vs. HS, DM and CKD4 was observed. After 3 months of dialysis therapy, the patients with CKD+DM showed a significant improvement only in the time-domain parameter SDANN/5 min, while the time-domain parameters SDNN, SDANN/5 min and SD were improved in CKD patients without diabetes. Frequency-domain parameters of HRV remained unchanged in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with worse cardiac autonomic function. Haemodialysis therapy for 3 months improves some indices of HRV, and this effect is more pronounced in non-diabetic subjects. Our findings suggest that the improvement of HRV after the initiation of chronic dialysis therapy can ameliorate clinical outcomes and survival in patients with end-stage renal disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study tests the hypothesis that stress reduction methods based on mindfulness meditation can positively influence the rate at which psoriasis clears in patients undergoing phototherapy or photochemotherapy treatment. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with psoriasis about to undergo ultraviolet phototherapy (UVB) or photochemotherapy (PUVA) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention guided by audiotaped instructions during light treatments, or a control condition consisting of the light treatments alone with no taped instructions. Psoriasis status was assessed in three ways: direct inspection by unblinded clinic nurses; direct inspection by physicians blinded to the patient's study condition (tape or no-tape); and blinded physician evaluation of photographs of psoriasis lesions. Four sequential indicators of skin status were monitored during the study: a First Response Point, a Turning Point, a Halfway Point, and a Clearing Point. RESULTS: Cox-proportional hazards regression analysis showed that subjects in the tape groups reached the Halfway Point (p = .013) and the Clearing Point (p = .033) significantly more rapidly than those in the no-tape condition, for both UVB and PUVA treatments. CONCLUSIONS: A brief mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention delivered by audiotape during ultraviolet light therapy can increase the rate of resolution of psoriatic lesions in patients with psoriasis.},

abstract = {Nowadays, millions of people around the world use social networking sites to express everyday thoughts and feelings. Many researchers have tried to make use of social media to study users' online behaviors and psychological states. However, previous studies show mixed results about whether self-generated contents on Facebook reflect users' subjective well-being (SWB). This study analyzed Facebook status updates to determine the extent to which users' emotional expression predicted their SWB—specifically their self-reported satis- faction with life. It was found that positive emotional expressions on Facebook did not correlate with life satisfaction, whereas negative emotional expressions within the past 9–10 months (but not beyond) were significantly related to life satisfaction. These findings suggest that both the type of emotional expressions and the time frame of status updates determine whether emotional expressions in Facebook status updates can effectively reflect users' SWB. The findings shed light on the characteristics of online social media and improve the understanding of how user-generated contents reflect users' psychological states.},

These techniques were characterized as indirect rather than direct tactics of self-presentation because they can be seen to influence one's image in the eyes of observers, not through the direct presentation of information about oneself but rather through the presentation of positive or negative information about something with which one is merely associated. In both experiments, it was found that after experiencing a visible personal failure, subjects enhanced the asserted quality of their home university (basking) and devalued the asserted quality of a rival university (blasting). Further, Experi- ment 2 showed that conditions designed to produce increasing levels of image damage resulted in increasing amounts of subsequent basking and blasting. It is suggested that because of a tendency within observers for cognitive balance, individuals highly desirous of increased public prestige arrange to be positively connected with positive things and negatively connected with negative things in the observers' eyes. Implications of these findings for the area of intergroup relations are discussed},

abstract = {An object moving towards an observer is subjectively perceived as longer in duration than the same object that is static or moving away. This "time dilation effect" has been shown for a number of stimuli that differ from standard events along different feature dimensions (e.g. color, size, and dynamics). We performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, while subjects viewed a stream of five visual events, all of which were static and of identical duration except the fourth one, which was a deviant target consisting of either a looming or a receding disc. The duration of the target was systematically varied and participants judged whether the target was shorter or longer than all other events. A time dilation effect was observed only for looming targets. Relative to the static standards, the looming as well as the receding targets induced increased activation of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortices (the "core control network"). The decisive contrast between looming and receding targets representing the time dilation effect showed strong asymmetric activation and, specifically, activation of cortical midline structures (the "default network"). These results provide the first evidence that the illusion of temporal dilation is due to activation of areas that are important for cognitive control and subjective awareness. The involvement of midline structures in the temporal dilation illusion is interpreted as evidence that time perception is related to self-referential processing.},

An initial study examined how tendencies toward mania (as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale) and tendencies toward depression (as measured by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression-Lifetime version) were related to diverse measures pertaining to incentive and threat motivations, negative and positive emotionality, and cognitive responses to emotion, among 238 undergraduates. Tendencies toward mania related to a self-reported pattern of reacting intensely to positive stimuli, both cognitively and emotionally, as well as lower sensitivity to threatening stimuli and less restraint over impulses. In contrast, tendencies toward depression related to a pattern of reacting more strongly to negative stimuli emotionally and cognitively, as well as deficits in the ability to savor positive affect. This pattern was re-confirmed in a second sample of 394 undergraduates, who completed many of the same measures plus a measure of current mood symptoms. This second sample confirmed that the pattern was not mood-state dependent. Implications for future research and clinical work are discussed, including an intriguing conceptual parallel in the distinct sets of correlates of depressive versus manic tendencies.},

We examine some of the ways in which the potential violation of these assumptions can lead us into significant theoretical and methodological error.

abstract = {The L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase (pcm) can stimulate
repair of isoaspartyl residues arising spontaneously in proteins
to normal L-aspartyl residues. PCM is needed in Escherichia coli
for maximal long-term survival when exposed to oxidative stress,
osmotic stress, repeated heat stress or methanol. The effect of pH
on a pcm mutant during long-term stationary phase was examined. PCM
was not required for long-term survival of E. coli subjected to pH
stress alone; however, PCM-deficient cells showed impaired resistance
to paraquat and methanol only at elevated pH. The mutant also showed
stress-survival phenotypes in minimal medium buffered to pH 9.0.
Accumulation of isoaspartyl residues was accelerated at pH 8.0 or
9.0 in vivo, though PCM-deficient cells did not show higher levels
of damage. However, the pcm mutant displayed an extended lag phase
in recovering from stationary phase at pH 9.0. Protein repair by
PCM thus plays a key role in long-term stress survival only at alkaline
pH in E. coli, and it may function primarily to repair damage in
cells that are recovering from nutrient limitation and in those cells
that are able to divide during long-term stationary phase.},

abstract = {This study compared the efficacy of 4 different hamstring-stretching
techniques. Flexibility can be achieved by a variety of stretching
techniques, yet little research has been performed on the most effective
method. The 2 basic types include active stretching, in which range
of motion is increased through voluntary contraction, and passive
stretching, in which range of motion is increased through external
assistance. The 2 types of active stretching include neuromobilization
and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). Our study aims
to determine which type of stretching technique is most effective
in improving hamstring length. One hundred subjects between the ages
of 21 and 57 were enrolled in the study. Intrarater reliability of
hamstring length measurement was performed using 10 subjects. All
100 subjects were included in a randomized controlled trial of 5
different groups comparing different hamstring-stretching techniques.
Outcome measures, including hamstring length and perceived level
of hamstring tightness, were recorded on all subjects initially,
at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of stretching, there was
a statistically significant improvement in hamstring length (p <
0.05) using active stretches as compared with passive stretches.
From weeks 4 through 8, hamstring length for the active stretching
groups decreased. After 8 weeks of stretching, the straight leg raise
(SLR) passive stretch group had the greatest improvement in hamstring
length. There was no correlation between hamstring flexibility and
age, initial tightness, or frequency of exercise per week. Improvement
in hamstring flexibility was greatest for the SLR passive stretch.
Also, using PNF in the 90/90 active stretch provided better knee
range-of-motion improvements than the 90/90 passive methods did.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe how the methodological quality of primary studies is assessed in systematic reviews and whether the quality assessment is taken into account in the interpretation of results.

DATA SOURCES: Cochrane systematic reviews and systematic reviews in paper based journals.

STUDY SELECTION: 965 systematic reviews (809 Cochrane reviews and 156 paper based reviews) published between 1995 and 2002.

DATA SYNTHESIS: The methodological quality of primary studies was assessed in 854 of the 965 systematic reviews (88.5%). This occurred more often in Cochrane reviews than in paper based reviews (93.9% v 60.3%, P < 0.0001). Overall, only 496 (51.4%) used the quality assessment in the analysis and interpretation of the results or in their discussion, with no significant differences between Cochrane reviews and paper based reviews (52% v 49%, P = 0.58). The tools and methods used for quality assessment varied widely.

CONCLUSIONS: Cochrane reviews fared better than systematic reviews published in paper based journals in terms of assessment of methodological quality of primary studies, although they both largely failed to take it into account in the interpretation of results. Methods for assessment of methodological quality by systematic reviews are still in their infancy and there is substantial room for improvement.},

  journal  = {International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research},
  abstract = {Background: There are no consistent predictors of treatment outcome in paediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). One reason for this might be the use of suboptimal statistical methodology. Machine learning is an approach to efficiently analyse complex data. Machine learning has been widely used within other fields, but has rarely been tested in the prediction of paediatric mental health treatment outcome. Objective: To test four different machine learning methods in the prediction of treatment response in a sample of paediatric OCD patients that had received internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT). Methods: All clinical baseline variables in N=61 adolescents (12-17 years) with OCD were used to predict treatment response three months after ICBT. Four machine learning algorithms were implemented. For comparison, we also employed a more traditional logistic regression approach. Results: Classical multivariate logistic regression could not detect any significant predictors. In contrast, all four machine learning algorithms performed well in the prediction of treatment response, with 75 to 83% accuracy. Conclusions: The results suggest that machine learning algorithms can successfully be applied to predict paediatric OCD treatment outcome. Validation studies and studies in other paediatric conditions are warranted.},

abstract = {<p><br/>Deep engagement in video game-playing has the potential to
be to be one important determinant of the impact of playing violent
video games, but there are currently no reliable measures of this
subjective experience. To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire
(GEQ) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study
1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality
of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has
adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality,
suggesting that one's tendency to become engaged in video game-playing
is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire
data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting
engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically
strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while
playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining
risk and protective factors for negative game impact.</p>},

abstract = {Often, health behavior seems to be governed not only by reasoned attitudes and goaldirected behavior but also by impulsive influences. The notion of a conflict between reflective and impulsive processing which is incorporated in prominent dual-system accounts (e.g., Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999; Strack & Deutsch, 2004) may yield important benefits for the understanding and prediction of health-related behavior. In this article, we suggest a basic framework for the prediction of health-related behavior which combines (a) reflective influences (as measured via self-report), (b) impulsive influences (as measured via implicit measures), and (c) situational or dispositional moderators that shift the weight between reflective and impulsive influences. The practical utility of such a framework is demonstrated by drawing on recent evidence from several areas of health psychology such as eating, drinking, drug abuse, and sexual behavior. Implications for the understanding of health behavior and applied health interventions are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research on educational data has demonstrated that Rasch fit statistics (mean squares and t-statistics) are highly susceptible to sample size variation for dichotomously scored rating data, although little is known about this relationship for polytomous data. These statistics help inform researchers about how well items fit to a unidimensional latent trait, and are an important adjunct to modern psychometrics. Given the increasing use of Rasch models in health research the purpose of this study was therefore to explore the relationship between fit statistics and sample size for polytomous data.

METHODS: Data were collated from a heterogeneous sample of cancer patients (n = 4072) who had completed both the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Ten samples were drawn with replacement for each of eight sample sizes (n = 25 to n = 3200). The Rating and Partial Credit Models were applied and the mean square and t-fit statistics (infit/outfit) derived for each model.

RESULTS: The results demonstrated that t-statistics were highly sensitive to sample size, whereas mean square statistics remained relatively stable for polytomous data.

CONCLUSION: It was concluded that mean square statistics were relatively independent of sample size for polytomous data and that misfit to the model could be identified using published recommended ranges.},

SAMPLING AND METHODS: A male patient is described who developed an acute and transient psychosis with polymorphic symptomatology after meditating. A literature search for psychotic states related to meditation was carried out on PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo.

RESULTS: In the case presented a diagnosis of acute polymorphic psychotic disorder was made. Other case reports dealt with either a relapse of a pre-existent psychotic disorder or with a brief psychotic reaction in patients without a psychiatric history.

CONCLUSION: Meditation can act as a stressor in vulnerable patients who may develop a transient psychosis with polymorphic symptomatology. The syndrome is not culture bound but sometimes classified in culture-bound taxonomies like Qi-gong Psychotic Reaction.},

Among positive traits, Positivity (POS), defined as a general disposition conducive to facing experience under a positive outlook has shown robust associations with psychological health. Thus, the present study investigated the extent to which POS is able to predict (i) relapse after quitting smoking and (ii) the desire to smoke again. All participants (481) had previously attended a Group Counselling Program (GCP) for Smoking Cessation (from 2005 through 2010). They were contacted through telephone interview. Among participants, 244 were ex-smokers (age: years 56.3 ± 10.08, 52% female) and 237 were still-smokers (age: years 55.0 ± 9.63; 63.5% female). The association of POS with "craving to smoke" levels was assessed with multivariate linear regression analysis while controlling also for important differences in personality such as conscientiousness and general self-efficacy, as well as for gender and age. Results showed that POS was significantly and negatively associated with smoking status and with craving to smoke. Among covariates (i.e., conscientiousness, generalized self-efficacy), gender was associated with smoking status and with craving to smoke. Altogether these findings corroborate the idea that POS plays a significant role in sustaining individuals' efforts to quit smoking.},

In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.

RESULTS: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.

CONCLUSION: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several studies have reported positive effects
of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention on psychological
well-being, it is not known whether these effects are attributable
to a change in mindfulness. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to
compare the effects of MBSR to a waiting-list control condition in
a randomized controlled trial while examining potentially mediating
effects of mindfulness. METHODS: Forty women and 20 men from the
community with symptoms of distress (mean age 43.6 years, SD = 10.1)
were randomized into a group receiving MBSR or a waiting-list control
group. Before and after the intervention period, questionnaires were
completed on psychological well-being, quality of life, and mindfulness.
RESULTS: Repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (MANCOVAs)
showed that, compared with the control group, the intervention resulted
in significantly stronger reductions of perceived stress (p = 0.016)
and vital exhaustion (p = 0.001) and stronger elevations of positive
affect (p = 0.006), quality of life (p = .009), as well as mindfulness
(p = 0.001). When mindfulness was included as a covariate in the
MANCOVA, the group effects on perceived stress and quality of life
were reduced to nonsignificance. CONCLUSION: Increased mindfulness
may, at least partially, mediate the positive effects of mindfulness-based
stress reduction intervention.},

documentation. Furthermore the mappings, quality of match, and experiences
of mapping was evaluated to discuss the domain completeness and utility
of the ICNP in depicting the typical situation of oncological patients.
The finding of this study will be submitted to the ICNP Review Process.
The results can contribute to extending the ICNP content. The new

But a distinction between mysticism and orthodox religion has been recognized by scholars as well as laypersons, and empirical studies of "ism" variables and of "spirituality" measures have yielded factors reflecting this distinction. Using a large sample of American adults, analyses demonstrate that subjective spirituality and tradition-oriented religiousness are empirically highly independent and have distinctly different correlates in the personality domain, suggesting that individuals with different dispositions tend toward different styles of religious/spiritual beliefs. These dimensions have low correlations with the lexical Big Five but high correlations with scales (e.g., Absorption, Traditionalism) on some omnibus personality inventories, indicating their relevance for studies of personality.},

We argue that norms do have a substantial impact on human action; however, the impact can only be properly recognized when researchers (a) separate 2 types of norms that at times act antagonistically in a situation—injunctive norms (what most others approve or disapprove) and descriptive norms (what most others do)—and (b) focus Ss' attention principally on the type of norm being studied. In 5 natural settings, focusing Ss on either the descriptive norms or the injunctive norms regarding littering caused the Ss' littering decisions to change only in accord with the dictates of the then more salient type of norm.},

Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the CA3, but not the CA1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.},

A taxonomy of these preferences, as well as of those for three separate types of triangle preference, is provided, based on factorial analysis. Two clear factors were demonstrated, one based on the square, and the other upon a proportion similar to that of the golden section.},

OBJECTIVE: To validate the 'Sinhala' translation of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) in-patient satisfaction with care questionnaire (IN-PATSAT32) in Sri Lanka. METHOD: We administered the translated version of the IN-PATSAT32 on 343 newly diagnosed adult in-patients with cancers of head and neck, breast, oesophagus, cervix uteri and lung, recruited from seven tertiary care oncology treatment centres in the District of Colombo. Patients with previous cancer diagnoses, too frail/mentally unfit, with evidence of brain metastases and unable/unwilling to give informed consent were excluded. Psychometric testing assessed the hypothesized scale structure, scale reliability, construct validity and acceptability of the IN-PATSAT32. RESULTS: A high response rate (100%) and low missing data (0.05%) confirmed the acceptability of the IN-PATSAT32. The hypothesized scale structure was confirmed with 100% item-convergent and 98.6% item-discriminant validity, and a scaling success rate, defined as items correlating significantly higher (more than 1.96 standard errors) with its own scale (corrected for overlap) than with another scale, of 97.9%. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency exceeded 0.70 in all scales. Construct validity was confirmed with inter-scale correlations, which were all statistically significant (P<0.01) and were of moderate-to-high magnitude, evidence that they were measuring distinct dimensions of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The translated version of the IN-PATSAT32 has proved to be a reliable and valid measure of satisfaction with cancer care in patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses in Sri Lanka.},

Thus, ambiguity--lacking information about another--leads to liking, whereas familiarity--acquiring more information--can breed contempt. This "less is more" effect is due to the cascading nature of dissimilarity: Once evidence of dissimilarity is encountered, subsequent information is more likely to be interpreted as further evidence of dissimilarity, leading to decreased liking. The authors document the negative relationship between knowledge and liking in laboratory studies and with pre- and postdate data from online daters, while showing the mediating role of dissimilarity.},

the term informal settlement, validate the term informal settlement,
and submit a term and definition for international utilization to
the International Council of Nurses (ICN) for consideration for inclusion
in the International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP). BACKGROUND
South Africa was one of four African countries (Botswana, South Africa,
Swaziland and Zimbabwe) funded by the WK Kellogg Foundation to participate
in the ICNP project. South Africa had two research groups. One of
the research groups identified the term informal settlement to define.
METHODS This was a qualitative study where a philosophical perspective
was used to explore, explain and describe nursing practice. The combined
method proposed by the ICN was utilized to define and validate the
term informal settlement. FINDINGS Validation and literature review
provided sufficient support for the defined characteristics and the
term was finally defined and submitted to ICN on 12 April 2001 as
informal settlement is a type of residential development with the
specific characteristics--temporary residential structures, erected
with limited or no formal infrastructure, densely populated, no secure
tenure for occupants, no property demarcations, often associated
with overcrowding/limited or no privacy, and low standard of living,
being situated in high risk areas with an increased risk for disease
and disasters. CONCLUSION The ICNP Evaluation Committee recommended
inclusion in the ICNP with minor changes in February 2003.},

abstract = {In six experiments we show that initial valuations of familiar products and simple hedonic experiences are strongly influenced by arbitrary 'anchors' (sometimes derived from a person's social security number). Because subsequent valuations are also coherent with respect to salient differences in perceived quality or quantity of these products and experiences, the entire pattern of valuations can easily create an illusion of order, as if it is being generated by stable underlying preferences. The experiments show that this combination of coherent arbitrariness (1) cannot be interpreted as a rational response to information, (2) does not decrease as a result of experience with a good, (3) is not necessarily reduced by market forces, and (4) is not unique to cash prices. The results imply that demand curves estimated from market data need not reveal true consumer preferences, in any normatively significant sense of the term. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

When data are well presented, it is usually obvious whether the author has collected and evaluated them correctly and in keeping with accepted practice in the field. METHODS: Statistical variables in medicine may be of either the metric (continuous, quantitative) or categorical (nominal, ordinal) type. Easily understandable examples are given. Basic techniques for the statistical description of collected data are presented and illustrated with examples. RESULTS: The goal of a scientific study must always be clearly defined. The definition of the target value or clinical endpoint determines the level of measurement of the variables in question. Nearly all variables, whatever their level of measurement, can be usefully presented graphically and numerically. The level of measurement determines what types of diagrams and statistical values are appropriate. There are also different ways of presenting combinations of two independent variables graphically and numerically. CONCLUSIONS: The description of collected data is indispensable. If the data are of good quality, valid and important conclusions can already be drawn when they are properly described. Furthermore, data description provides a basis for inferential statistics.},

abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice of p value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specifi- cation of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

abstract = {Mindfulness has been defined as a state of consciousness involving intentional attention and awareness of the present moment. Reporting on past conscious experience is inherently tricky and presents unique challenges to the assessment of mindfulness. Mindfulness-present and mindfulness-absent items may represent different aspects of the construct to different populations resulting from differential skill in assessing sustained or lapsed conscious attention. The current study shows that an online sample of meditators and non-meditators with similar overall levels of mindfulness differentially endorse response options for positively and negatively worded items. While meditators endorse mindfulness-present and mindfulness-absent items with nearly equivalent frequency, student non-meditators are much more likely to reject mindfulness-absent items than to accept mindfulness-present items. The differential item functioning between these two groups represents a potential problem regarding construct validity when comparing meditators to non-meditators and when assessing mindfulness as a pre-post measure with meditation practice.},

abstract = {Hallucinogenic psilocybin is known to alter the subjective experience of time. However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation.},

The present study investigated whether mere exposure also affects actual choice behavior. Participants named landmarks shown on photographs. In two experimental conditions, the photographs also unobtrusively showed posters depicting the logo of either a lemon candy or a peppermint candy; in a control condition, no posters were shown. Later participants could choose between the two products as a reward. Participants who had been exposed to the lemon logo and control participants chose the lemon candy more frequently, whereas for participants who had been exposed to the peppermint logo, this preference reversed: they chose the peppermint candy more frequently. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.},

abstract = {AIM This paper reports a systematic review on the outcomes of nursing
diagnostics. Specifically, it examines effects on documentation of
assessment quality; frequency, accuracy and completeness of nursing
diagnoses; and on coherence between nursing diagnoses, interventions
and outcomes. BACKGROUND Escalating healthcare costs demand the measurement
of nursing's contribution to care. Use of standardized terminologies
facilitates this measurement. Although several studies have evaluated
nursing diagnosis documentation and their relationship with interventions
and outcomes, a systematic review has not been carried out. METHOD
A Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database search (1982-2004) was conducted
and enhanced by the addition of primary source and conference proceeding
articles. Inclusion criteria were established and applied. Thirty-six
articles were selected and subjected to thematic content analysis;
each study was then assessed, and a level of evidence and grades
of recommendations assigned. FINDINGS Nursing diagnosis use improved
the quality of documented patient assessments (n = 14 studies), identification
of commonly occurring diagnoses within similar settings (n = 10),
and coherence among nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes
(n = 8). Four studies employed a continuing education intervention
and found statistically significant improvements in the documentation
of diagnoses, interventions and outcomes. However, limitations in
diagnostic accuracy, reporting of signs/symptoms, and aetiology were
also reported (14 studies). One meta-analysis of eight trials including
1497 patients showed no evidence that standardized electronic documentation
of nursing diagnosis and related interventions led to better nursing
outcomes. CONCLUSION Despite variable results, the trend indicated
that nursing diagnostics improved assessment documentation, the quality
of interventions reported, and outcomes attained. The study reveals
deficits in reporting of signs/symptoms and aetiology. Consequently,
staff educational measures to enhance diagnostic accuracy are recommended.
The relationships among diagnoses, interventions and outcomes require
further evaluation. Studies are needed to determine the relationship
between the quality of documentation and practice.},

abstract = {Meditation practice is difficult to access because of its countless forms of appearances originating from the complexity of cultures it has to serve. This makes a suitable categorization for scientific use almost impossible. However, empirical data suggest that different forms of meditation show similar steps of development in terms of their neurophysiological correlates. Some electrophysiological alterations can be observed on the beginner/student level, which are closely related to non-meditative processes. Others seem to correspond to an advanced/expert level, and seem to be unique for meditation-related states of consciousness. Meditation is one possibility to specialize brain/mind functions using the brain's immanent neural plasticity. This plasticity is probably recruited by certain EEG patterns observed during or as a result of meditation, for instance, synchronized gamma oscillations. While meditation formerly has been understood to comprise mainly passive relaxation states, recent EEG findings suggest that meditation is associated with active states which involve cognitive restructuring and learning.},

abstract = {Our ability to generate and collect data has been increasing rapidly. Not only are all of our business, scientific, and government transactions now computerized, but the widespread use of digital cameras, publication tools, and bar codes also generate data. On the collection side, scanned text and image platforms, satellite remote sensing systems, and the World Wide Web have flooded us with a tremendous amount of data. This explosive growth has generated an even more urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and knowledge. Like the first edition, voted the most popular data mining book by KD Nuggets readers, this book explores concepts and techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets, focusing on issues relating to their feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability. However, since the publication of the first edition, great progress has been made in the development of new data mining methods, systems, and applications. This new edition substantially enhances the first edition, and new chapters have been added to address recent developments on mining complex types of data- including stream data, sequence data, graph structured data, social network data, and multi-relational data. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a new student of data mining, this book has much to offer you: A comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to know to get the most out of real business data. Updates that incorporate input from readers, changes in the field, and more material on statistics and machine learning. Dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in easily understood pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects.

(MMSE) scores by age and educational level. DESIGN National Institute
of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program surveys conducted
between 1980 and 1984. SETTING Community populations in New Haven,
Conn; Baltimore, Md; St Louis, Mo; Durham, NC; and Los Angeles, Calif.
PARTICIPANTS A total of 18,056 adult participants selected by probability
sampling within census tracts and households. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Summary scores for the MMSE are given in the form of mean, median,
and percentile distributions specific for age and educational level.
RESULTS The MMSE scores were related to both age and educational
level. There was an inverse relationship between MMSE scores and
age, ranging from a median of 29 for those 18 to 24 years of age,
to 25 for individuals 80 years of age and older. The median MMSE
score was 29 for individuals with at least 9 years of schooling,
26 for those with 5 to 8 years of schooling, and 22 for those with
0 to 4 years of schooling. CONCLUSIONS Cognitive performance as measured
by the MMSE varies within the population by age and education. The
cause of this variation has yet to be determined. Mini-Mental State
Examination scores should be used to identify current cognitive difficulties
and not to make formal diagnoses. The results presented should prove
to be useful to clinicians who wish to compare an individual patient's
MMSE scores with a population reference group and to researchers
making plans for new studies in which cognitive status is a variable
of interest.},

abstract = {Sex differences in children's toy play are robust and similar across cultures [1,2]. They include girls tending to play more with dolls and boys more with wheeled toys and pretend weaponry. This pattern is explained by socialization by elders and peers, male rejection of opposite-sex behavior and innate sex differences in activity preferences that are facilitated by specific toys [1]. Evidence for biological factors is controversial but mounting. For instance, girls who have been exposed to high fetal androgen levels are known to make relatively masculine toy choices [3]. Also, when presented with sex-stereotyped human toys, captive female monkeys play more with typically feminine toys, whereas male monkeys play more with masculine toys [1]. In human and nonhuman primates, juvenile females demonstrate a greater interest in infants, and males in rough-and-tumble play. This sex difference in activity preferences parallels adult behavior and may contribute to differences in toy play [1]. Here, we present the first evidence of sex differences in use of play objects in a wild primate, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play and, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction is a function of several variables addressing reasons why it is important to use methods in which these different factors can be isolated and their importance analysed. OBJECTIVE: In this project, two methods using this approach were used: the 'Quality from the Patient's Perspective' and the 'Quality, Satisfaction, Performance' models. The aim of the present study is to evaluate these two different methods with respect to application, strengths and weaknesses. DESIGN: In the Quality from the Patient's Perspective model, the patient judges the different domains in two dimensions: perceived reality and subjective importance. The Quality, Satisfaction, Performance model uses a multivariate analysis to capture the patient's priorities. Four hundred and sixty forms for each model were distributed to a random sample of patients at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Karolinska Hospital. MAIN MEASURES: The quality factors 'treatment by the nurse', 'participation', 'information', 'environment' and 'accessibility' were measured. RESULTS: On both forms, 'medical care', 'treatment by the doctor' and 'access to nursing treatment' received high scores in perceived reality' while 'accessibility' and 'participation' received low scores. 'Subjective importance' measured directly and indirectly, respectively, in the two models showed high values for 'medical care' and 'treatment by the doctor'. CONCLUSION: The advantages of the Quality from the Patient's Perspective model are that it has a comprehensive and solid question bank. The Quality, Satisfaction, Performance model's advantage is its immediate usefulness and its clear graphic presentation. An integration and further development of these two approaches may prove useful.},

abstract = {Published January 2006, 223 pages. SUMMARY: Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information at a glance. Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste. This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. "Information Dashboard Design" will explain how to: Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard design Provide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearly Apply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of information Minimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusion Organize business information to support meaning and usability Create an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience Maintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretation Optimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectiveness Stephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an IT innovator, consultant, and educator.

abstract = {The effect of simulated bilateral knee-flexion contractures (KFC)
on the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the vastus lateralis was
studied by testing 10 normal subjects using surface EMG to test the
hypothesis that the activity of the knee extensors would increase
as a function of the severity of the contracture. The root mean square
of the EMG activity was determined from four 4-s samples taken at
30-s intervals, during 2 min of standing in each of five positions
of simulated KFC (0 degree, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees and
40 degrees). A randomly balanced order of conditions was used. KFC
were simulated in each subject by means of an adjustable line from
the subject's waist to the sole of each foot. An analysis of variance
was used to contrast EMG activity, and a significant difference was
found between each of the positions (P less than 0.05). The mean
(+/- 1 SD) EMG activity, expressed as a percentage of the maximum
voluntary contraction, was 0.3% (+/- 0.2) at 0 degree, 7.6% (+/-
5.6) at 10 degrees, 10.9% (+/- 7.6) at 20 degrees, 16.6% (+/- 12.4)
at 30 degrees and 24.0% (+/- 14.0) at 40 degrees. A linear relationship
was found (r2 = 0.986), expressed by the equation y = 0.62 + 0.56
x, where y represents EMG activity and x represents the extent of
simulated KFC (P = 0.0007). The results provide insight into the
increased knee extensor activity necessary to stand with KFC and
underline the importance of treating this common disorder.},

By examining conditions in which personal control was either present or absent it was possible to distinguish between the two positions.

@article{Fliege2005a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to translate, revise, and standardize the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) by Levenstein et al. (1993) in German. The instrument assesses subjectively experienced stress independent of a specific and objective occasion.

METHODS: Exploratory factor analyses and a revision of the scale content were carried out on a sample of 650 subjects (Psychosomatic Medicine patients, women after delivery, women after miscarriage, and students). Confirmatory analyses and examination of structural stability across subgroups were carried out on a second sample of 1,808 subjects (psychosomatic, tinnitus, inflammatory bowel disease patients, pregnant women, healthy adults) using linear structural equation modeling and multisample analyses. External validation included immunological measures in women who had suffered a miscarriage.

RESULTS: Four factors (worries, tension, joy, demands) emerged, with 5 items each, as compared with the 30 items of the original PSQ. The factor structure was confirmed on the second sample. Multisample analyses yielded a fair structural stability across groups. Reliability values were satisfactory. Findings suggest that three scales represent internal stress reactions, whereas the scale "demands" relates to perceived external stressors. Significant and meaningful differences between groups indicate differential validity. A higher degree of certain immunological imbalances after miscarriage (presumably linked to pregnancy loss) was found in those women who had a higher stress score. Sensitivity to change was demonstrated in two different treatment samples.

CONCLUSION: We propose the revised PSQ as a valid and economic tool for stress research. The overall score permits comparison with results from earlier studies using the original instrument.},

abstract = {To comprehend the results of a randomized, controlled trial (RCT), readers must understand its design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation. That goal can be achieved only through complete transparency from authors. Despite several decades of educational efforts, the reporting of RCTs needs improvement. Investigators and editors developed the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to help authors improve reporting by using a checklist and flow diagram. The revised CONSORT statement presented in this paper incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the original statement. The checklist items pertain to the content of the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revised checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting the information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect or because the information is essential to judge the reliability or relevance of the findings. We intended the flow diagram to depict the passage of participants through an RCT. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of trial (enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and analysis). The diagram explicitly includes the number of participants, for each intervention group, that are included in the primary data analysis. Inclusion of these numbers allows the reader to judge whether the authors have performed an intention-to-treat analysis. In sum, the CONSORT statement is intended to improve the reporting of an RCT, enabling readers to understand a trial's conduct and to assess the validity of its results.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many changes have been initiated in the Dutch hospital sector to optimize health-care delivery: national agenda-setting, increased competition and transparency, a new system of hospital reimbursement based on diagnosis-treatment combinations, intensified monitoring of quality and a multi-layered organizational development programme based on quality improvement collaboratives. The objective is to answer the question as to whether these changes were accompanied by a further development of hospital quality management systems and to what extent did the development within the multi-layered programme hospitals differ from that in other hospitals. DESIGN: Longitudinal data were collected in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2007 using a validated questionnaire. Descriptive analyses and multi-level modelling were applied to test whether: (1) quality management system development stages in hospitals differ over time, (2) development stages and trends differ between hospitals participating or not participating in the multi-layered programme and (3) hospital size has an effect on development stage. SETTING: Dutch hospital sector between 1995 and 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital organizations. INTERVENTION: Changes through time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality management system development stage. RESULTS: Since 1995, hospital quality management systems have reached higher development levels. Programme participants have developed their quality management system more rapidly than have non-participants. However, this effect is confounded by hospital size. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest that the combination of policy measures at macro level was accompanied by an increase in hospital size and the further development of quality management systems. Hospitals are entering the stage of systematic quality improvement.},

The 5-week program demonstrated that sustained interest in this material in middle school-aged boys and girls is possible. Statements the boys and girls made in the process suggested that they experienced well-being, calmness, relaxation, improved sleep, less reactivity, increased self-care, self-awareness, and a sense of interconnection or interdependence with nature. The curriculum is described in detail for nurses, teachers, and counselors who want to replicate this type of instruction for adolescent children. This project infers that Tai Chi and mindfulness-based stress reduction may be transformational tools that can be used in educational programs appropriate for middle school-aged children. Recommendations are made for further study in schools and other pediatric settings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sleep loss and sleep disruption are common in critically ill patients and may adversely affect clinical outcomes. Although polysomnography remains the most accurate and reliable way to measure sleep, it is costly and impractical for regular use in the intensive care unit. This study evaluates the accuracy of two other methods currently used for measuring sleep, actigraphy (monitoring of gross motor activity) and behavioural assessment by the bedside nurse, by comparing them to overnight polysomnography in critically ill patients.

DESIGN: Observational study with simultaneous polysomnography, actigraphy and behavioural assessment of sleep.

SETTING: Medical-surgical intensive care unit.

PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Twelve stable, critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients [68 (13) years, Glasgow coma scale 11 (0)].

INTERVENTIONS: None.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was severely disrupted, reflected by decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, high frequency of arousals and awakenings and abnormal sleep architecture. Actigraphy overestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency. The overall agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography was <65%. Nurse assessment underestimated the number of awakenings from sleep. Estimated total sleep time, sleep efficiency and number of awakenings by nurse assessment did not correlate with polysomnographic findings.

CONCLUSIONS: Actigraphy and behavioural assessment by the bedside nurse are inaccurate and unreliable methods to monitor sleep in critically ill patients.},

Some of the many graphical tools that are useful in this setting are scatterplot matrices, nonparametric smoothers, and tree diagrams. Statistical graphics for presenting information have been used much longer, but most of the commonly used graphics used in papers, presentations, and the popular media, such as bar charts and pie charts, are either poor or misleading in communicating information to the reader. This tutorial begins with a series of graphical horror stories from the scientific and lay press. Then elements of graphical perception and good graph construction, many from the writings of Bill Cleveland, are covered. Practical suggestions for choosing the best chart or graph type, making good and clear graphics, and formatting are covered. Techniques for simultaneous presentation of multiple variables are described. Examples of model presentation graphics will also be given. The second part of the tutorial consists of interactive demonstrations of how to make effective statistical graphics using the freely available R environment for data analysis and graphics (www.R-project.org). This will focus on base, lattice and ggplot2 graphics as well as graphics functions in the presenter's Hmisc package. At the close of the workshop some graphical marvels from the literature (especially from Edward Tufte and Howard Wainer) are presented.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effects of burnout and perceived stress on early morning
free cortisol levels after awakening were investigated in a group
of teachers. Previous studies revealed that cortisol levels show
a significant increase after awakening, with high intraindividual
stability. METHODS: Sixty-six teachers from local public schools
(42 women and 24 men, mean age 42 ± 5 years) were asked to sample
saliva for cortisol analysis on 3 consecutive days. On each day,
cortisol levels were measured at the time of awakening and 15, 30,
and 60 minutes thereafter. On the night before the third day, subjects
took 0.5 mg dexamethasone orally for testing glucocorticoid feedback
inhibition. Burnout and perceived stress were measured by three different
questionnaires. RESULTS: Perceived stress correlated with increases
of cortisol levels during the first hour after awakening after dexamethasone
pretreatment. In addition, teachers scoring high on burnout showed
lower overall cortisol secretion on all sampling days, and a higher
suppression of cortisol secretion after dexamethasone administration.
In the subgroup of teachers with both high levels of perceived stress
and high levels of burnout, a lower overall cortisol secretion was
observed on the first 2 days, with stronger increases during the
first hour after awakening after dexamethasone suppression. This
subgroup also showed the lowest self-esteem, the highest external
locus of control, and the highest number of somatic complaints. CONCLUSIONS:
These results demonstrate differential effects of burnout and perceived
stress on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation.},

By using the logic of priming research, in Study 1 the authors showed that the strength of the anchor effect depends on the applicability of activated information. Study 2 revealed a contrast effect when the activated information was not representative for the absolute judgment and the targets of the 2 judgment tasks were sufficiently different. Study 3 demonstrated that generating absolute judgments requires more time when comparative judgments include an implausible anchor and can therefore be made without relevant target information that would otherwise be accessible.},

A theory of dynamic choice reconstruction is presented to account for this effect. The theory is based on ideas of dominance seeking, in which the decision maker actively looks for ways to simplify the task. Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

abstract = {The measurement of pupil diameter in psychology (in short, �pupillometry�)
has just celebrated 50 years. The method established itself after
the appearance of three seminal studies (Hess & Polt, 1960, 1964;
Kahneman & Beatty, 1966). Since then, the method has continued to
play a significant role within the field, and pupillary responses
have been successfully used to provide an estimate of the �intensity�
of mental activity and of changes in mental states, particularly
changes in the allocation of attention and the consolidation of perception.
Remarkably, pupillary responses provide a continuous measure regardless
of whether the participant is aware of such changes. More recently,
research in neuroscience has revealed a tight correlation between
the activity of the locus coeruleus (i.e., the �hub� of the noradrenergic
system) and pupillary dilation. As we discuss in this short review,
these neurophysiological findings provide new important insights
to the meaning of pupillary responses for mental activity. Finally,
given that pupillary responses can be easily measured in a noninvasive
manner, occur from birth, and can occur in the absence of voluntary,
conscious processes, they constitute a very promising tool for the
study of preverbal (e.g., infants) or nonverbal participants (e.g.,
animals, neurological patients).},

@article{Smith2003a,
abstract = {The invariance of the estimated parameters across variation in the
incidental parameters of a sample is one of the most important properties
of Rasch measurement models. This is the property that allows the
equating of test forms and the use of computer adaptive testing.
It necessarily follows that in Rasch models if the data fit the model,
than the estimation of the parameter of interest must be invariant
across sub-samples of the items or persons. This study investigates
the degree to which the INFIT and OUTFIT item fit statistics in WINSTEPS
detect violations of the invariance property of Rasch measurement
models. The test in this study is a 80 item multiple-choice test
used to assess mathematics competency. The WINSTEPS analysis of the
dichotomous results, based on a sample of 2000 from a very large
number of students who took the exam, indicated that only 7 of the
80 items misfit using the 1.3 mean square criteria advocated by Linacre
and Wright. Subsequent calibration of separate samples of 1,000 students
from the upper and lower third of the person raw score distribution,
followed by a t-test comparison of the item calibrations, indicated
that the item difficulties for 60 of the 80 items were more than
2 standard errors apart. The separate calibration t-values ranged
from +21.00 to -7.00 with the t-test value of 41 of the 80 comparisons
either larger than +5 or smaller than -5. Clearly these data do not
exhibit the invariance of the item parameters expected if the data
fit the model. Yet the INFIT and OUTFIT mean squares are completely
insensitive to the lack of invariance in the item parameters. If
the OUTFIT ZSTD from WINSTEPS was used with a critical value of |
t | > 2.0, then 56 of the 60 items identified by the separate calibration
t-test would be identified as misfitting. A fourth measure of misfit,
the between ability-group item fit statistic identified 69 items
as misfitting when a critical value of t > 2.0 was used. Clearly
relying solely on the INFIT and OUTFIT mean squares in WINSETPS to
assess the fit of the data to the model would cause one to miss one
of the most important threats to the usefulness of the measurement
model.},

abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic implications of alterations in heart rate variability have not been studied in a large community-based population. METHODS AND RESULTS: The first 2 hours of ambulatory ECG recordings obtained on original subjects of the Framingham Heart Study attending the 18th biennial examination were reprocessed to assess heart rate variability. Subjects with transient or persistent nonsinus rhythm, premature beats > 10% of total beats, < 1 hour of recording time, processed time < 50% of recorded time, and those taking antiarrhythmic medications were excluded. The associations between heart rate variability measures and all-cause mortality during 4 years of follow-up were assessed. There were 736 eligible subjects with a mean age (+/- SD) of 72 +/- 6 years. The following five frequency domain measures and three time domain measures were obtained: very-low-frequency power (0.01 to 0.04 Hz), low-frequency power (0.04 to 0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (0.15 to 0.40 Hz), total power (0.01 to 0.40 Hz), the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power, the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals, the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are > 50 milliseconds, and the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals. During follow-up, 74 subjects died. In separate proportional hazards regression analyses that adjusted for relevant risk factors, very-low-frequency power (P < .0001), low-frequency power (P < .0001), high-frequency power (P = .0014), total power (P < .0001), and the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals (P = .0019) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. When all eight heart rate variability measures were assessed in a stepwise analysis that included other risk factors, low-frequency power entered the model first (P < .0001); thereafter, none of the other measures of heart rate variability significantly contributed to the prediction of all-cause mortality. A 1 SD decrement in low-frequency power (natural log transformed) was associated with 1.70 times greater hazard for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval of 1.37 to 2.09). CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of heart rate variability by ambulatory monitoring offers prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional risk factors.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to do a pilot
test of the effectiveness of prolonged stretch (use of a splint)
in reducing knee flexion contractures more than a traditional program
of passive range of motion (PROM) in a group of nursing home residents.
Subjects. The subjects were 28 nursing home residents with 10 degrees
or more of knee flexion contracture bilaterally. Eighteen subjects
completed the study. Methods. Data were collected prior to the initiation
of the intervention and at monthly intervals during the 6 months
of treatment. Repeated measurements were made of hip, knee, and ankle
range of motion (ROM); the torque required to maintain passive knee
extension; knee pain; several indicators of function; and cognitive
impairment. Both legs of each subject received PROM and manual stretching
twice a week; in addition, one leg was given a prolonged stretch
(use of a splint) five times a week. Results. There were no differences
in knee ROM between the side that received prolonged stretching and
the side that received only PROM and manual stretching at the beginning
of the study. No differences in ROM or torque measurements existed
between the side that received prolonged stretching and the side
that received only PROM and manual stretching at any interval, nor
in ROM or torque over time for either side. Because of the low statistical
power of the study, the results should be viewed with caution. Conclusion
and Discussion. Physical therapists need to question whether prolonged
stretch for nursing home residents with knee flexion contractures
greater than 10 degrees is of any greater benefit than PROM and manual
stretching. Investigations of other treatment protocols and treatment
doses are needed, including work in the area of prevention of knee
flexion contractures. For the pilot group of nursing home residents
studied, gains in knee extension did not occur with the use of prolonged
stretch for 3 hours a day, 5 days per week.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and initial validation of the self-administered Client Perceptions of Coordination Questionnaire. DESIGN: The instrument was developed between 1996 and 1997 through iterative item generation; within a framework of six domains of coordination, addressed across four sectors of health care provision. SETTING: 1193 individuals with complex and chronic health care needs as judged by their general practitioners (GPs), who were participants in a 2-year randomized controlled trial of a coordinated care intervention in Australia. Other samples were collected in one general practice (98) and from attendees of a chronic pain management course (29). MAIN MEASURES: Face and content validity, completion rates, transferability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the 32-item instrument. RESULTS: Most items achieved excellent completion and comprehension rates. The instrument was transferable to another chronically unwell population. Cronbach's alpha of the entire instrument was 0.92, and for six individual scales scores ranged from 0.31 to 0.86. The six scales based on principal components analysis were acceptability, received care, GP, nominated provider, client comprehension, and client capacity. The first four scales were satisfactory, but the client scales were inadequate with poor internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity. People with chronic pain syndromes had significantly worse experiences for almost all items, supporting construct validity. CONCLUSION: This instrument is one of the first to attempt to measure coordination of health care. Its strengths include ease of completion, transferability, and promising psychometric properties and construct validity. Problems capturing data about the patient's contribution to coordination highlight a lack of theoretical development in this area. A valid measure of coordination should be useful in needs assessment, program evaluation, and individual provider/practice audit, and would contribute to research into the experience and measurement of patient-focused care.},

The aim of this article is to review current evidence on the therapeutic efficacy of MBIs for SUM. A literature search was undertaken using four electronic databases and references of retrieved articles. The search included articles written in English published up to December 2011. Quality of included trials was assessed. In total, 24 studies were included, three of which were based on secondary analyses of previously investigated samples. Current evidence suggests that MBIs can reduce the consumption of several substances including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes, and opiates to a significantly greater extent than waitlist controls, non-specific educational support groups, and some specific control groups. Some preliminary evidence also suggests that MBIs are associated with a reduction in craving as well as increased mindfulness. The limited generalizability of the reviewed findings is noted (i.e., small sample size, lack of methodological details, and the lack of consistently replicated findings). More rigorous and larger randomized controlled studies are warranted.},

abstract = {Background: Mindfulness may be viewed as a supra-cognitive state of consciousness focussed on the decentred, objective and compassionate observation of transient mental and physical phenomena that may be attained through meditation practices. Mindfulness meditation is thought to be beneficial in the management of various physical and mental health conditions. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation practice as a healthcare intervention. Methods: Systematic computerised and hand literature searches for randomised controlled trials and evaluation using methodological quality criteria. Results: The higher quality studies analysed in this review have demonstrated replicated statistically significant improvements in spirituality and positive health measures and decreases in depressive relapse, depressive recurrence and psychological distress. Conclusions: Despite the lack of specific, reliable and validated mindfulness measures, mindfulness shows potential as a positive healthcare intervention and continued investigation is warranted. Further research using improved methodology and utilising specific mindfulness outcome measures in trials with long-term follow up, larger populations and a wider demographic range is recommended. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Schunemann2009a,
abstract = {The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group represents an international collaboration of guideline developers, clinicians, health services researchers and methodologists. Many leading organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), use the GRADE approach because it has led to progress in the assessment of evidence and in the development of healthcare recommendations. The GRADE system distinguishes the quality of evidence from the strength of a recommendation. The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence that an estimate of effect is correct if it is used in the context of single endpoints. In the context of giving guidance, it reflects the extent to which confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support recommendations. The strength of a recommendation, separated into strong and weak or conditional recommendations for or against an intervention, is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. A recommendation for action requires consideration for the magnitude of the expected benefit and downsides of an intervention for all patientimportant endpoints, the associate values and preferences and resource use. The GRADE system includes a systematic approach to evaluate the generalizability of study results to healthcare practice. Judgments about generalizability, better termed directness, are separated into judgments about the availability of direct comparisons between two alternative management strategies and judgments about differences between the population, intervention, comparator to the intervention, and outcomes (PICO) of interest for a given question, and those included in the relevant studies. In addition to providing an overview of the GRADE system, this article focuses on the approach to assessing directness or generalizability.},

abstract = {Ageing is related to significant declines in cognitive functioning. This effect can have a serious impact on the physical and psychological health of older adults as well as their quality of life. One phenomenon linked to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, that has been demonstrated to emerge with ageing is over-selectivity. Over-selectivity occurs when behavior is controlled by a limited number of stimuli in the environment. Mindfulness is a construct that specifically targets attention and awareness of the present moment. The current study aimed to remediate over-selectivity in an elderly population by means of a focused attention/mindfulness induction. The results of this study indicated that the level of emergent over-selectivity in an elderly population was significantly reduced after a focused attention induction when compared to an unfocused attention induction. The findings are discussed in terms of the efficacy of mindfulness training in reducing over-selectivity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Medical communication can be a stressful experience for both doctors and patients. In particular, inexperienced doctors facing the demanding task of a bad news consultation may experience high levels of distress. The aim of this exploratory study is to test students' differential cardiovascular reactivity to history taking and bad news consultations with a simulated patient, and to test the relation between the students' self-reported stressfulness of the consultation and their cardiovascular response.

METHODS: Fourth and fifth year medical students (n=20) conducted a history taking (HT) and a bad news (BN) consultation in a randomized order with a standardized patient. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were assessed by way of the Finapres-technique in four conditions: rest, reading aloud, and during both consultations. Self-reported stress was assessed before and after each interview using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a visual analogue scale (VAS).

RESULTS: Both HT and BN provoked more cardiovascular stress than reading. Bad-news provoked the highest HR and CO responses compared to all other conditions, and had a greater impact when it was the student's first consultation. The STAI and VAS data showed some correlations with the cardiovascular stress measures and a comparable but less significant pattern in stress response.

DISCUSSION: The effect of order of the HT and BN consultations on the students' stress levels suggests an additional impact of novelty and habituation. Unfamiliarity with the patient may enhance the stressfulness of the task of breaking bad news.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated associations between ambient pollution levels and cardiovascular function in a repeated measures study including 163 observations on twenty-one 53- to 87-year-old active Boston residents observed up to 12 times from June to September 1997. Particles with aerodynamic diameter </=2.5 microm (PM(2.5)) were measured continuously using a tapered element oscillating microbalance. METHODS AND RESULTS: The protocol involved 25 minutes per week of continuous Holter ECG monitoring, including 5 minutes of rest, 5 minutes of standing, 5 minutes of exercise outdoors, 5 minutes of recovery, and 20 cycles of slow breathing. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed through time domain variables: the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (r-MSSD). Mean 4-hour PM(2.5) levels ranged from 3 to 49 microg/m(3); 1-hour ozone levels ranged from 1 to 77 ppb. In multivariate analyses, significantly less HRV (SDNN and r-MSSD) was associated with elevated PM(2.5). During slow breathing, a reduction in r-MSSD of 6.1 ms was associated with an interquartile (14.3 microg/m(3)) increase in PM(2.5) during the hour of and the 3 hours previous to the Holter session (P=0.006). During slow breathing, a multiple pollution model was associated with a reduction in r-MSSD of 5.4 ms (P=0.02) and 5.5 ms (P=0.03) for interquartile changes in PM(2.5) and ozone, respectively, resulting in a combined effect equivalent to a 33% reduction in the mean r-MSSD. CONCLUSIONS: Particle and ozone exposure may decrease vagal tone, resulting in reduced HRV.},

abstract = {Background: Repetitive loading to the hip joint in athletes has been
reported as a factor in the development of degenerative joint disease
and intra-articular injury. Little information is available on the
bilateral symmetry of hip rotational measures in unilaterally dominant
upper extremity athletes.Hypothesis: Side-to-side differences in
hip joint range of motion may be present because of asymmetrical
loading in the lower extremities of elite tennis players and professional
baseball pitchers.Study Design: Cohort (cross-sectional) study (prevalence);
Level of evidence, 1.Methods: Descriptive measures of hip internal
and external rotation active range of motion were taken in the prone
position of 64 male and 83 female elite tennis players and 101 male
professional baseball pitchers using digital photos and computerized
angle calculation software. Bilateral differences in active range
of motion between the dominant and nondominant hip were compared
using paired t tests and Bonferroni correction for hip internal,
external, and total rotation range of motion. A Pearson correlation
test was used to test the relationship between years of competition
and hip rotation active range of motion.Results: No significant bilateral
difference (P > .005) was measured for mean hip internal or external
rotation for the elite tennis players or the professional baseball
pitchers. An analysis of the number of subjects in each group with
a bilateral difference in hip rotation greater than 10° identified
17% of the professional baseball pitchers with internal rotation
differences and 42% with external rotation differences. Differences
in the elite male tennis players occurred in only 15% of the players
for internal rotation and 9% in external rotation. Female subjects
had differences in 8% and 12% of the players for internal and external
rotation, respectively. Statistical differences were found between
the mean total arc of hip range of internal and external rotation
in the elite tennis players with the dominant side being greater
by a clinically insignificant mean value of 2.5°. Significantly
less (P < .005) dominant hip internal rotation and less dominant
and nondominant hip total rotation range of motion were found in
the professional baseball pitchers compared with the elite male tennis
players.Conclusion: This study established typical range of motion
patterns and identified bilaterally symmetric hip active range of
motion rotation values in elite tennis players and professional baseball
pitchers. Asymmetric hip joint rotational active range of motion
encountered during clinical examination and screening may indicate
abnormalities and would indicate the application of flexibility training,
rehabilitation, and further evaluation.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional multi-practice study using the general practice assessment survey. SETTING: General practices in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-six general practices and 7505 chronic illness patients aged >or=18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Access of care and patient-centredness. RESULTS: Two factors were identified in factor analysis: 'Access of care' and 'Patient-centredness'. Multilevel regression analysis showed significant associations between patients' assessments and patient and practice characteristics. Patients from smaller practices (one to three general practitioners) reported better access to care compared with larger practices. Patients from urban areas were more satisfied with patient-centredness than those from rural areas. Self-reported health status and age had a positive and home ownership, employment and education, and patients from non-English-speaking countries a negative relationship with both scores. Females were more satisfied with patient-centredness. CONCLUSIONS: Patient assessments of quality of care and patient-centredness were strongly associated with practice and patient characteristics. This has important implications for interpreting assessments of the quality of primary care, and for policy and practice measures designed to improve this.},

abstract = {Most people are born creative. But over time, a lot of us learn to stifle those impulses. We become warier of judgment, more cautious, more analytical. The world seems to divide into "creatives" and "noncreatives," and too many people resign themselves to the latter category. And yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry. The good news, according to authors Tom Kelley and David Kelley of IDEO, is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence. The trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back: fear of the messy unknown, fear of judgment, fear of the first step, and fear of losing control. The authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias: You break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another. Creativity is something you practice, say the authors, not just a talent you are born with. INSET: Tackling the Mess, One Step at a Time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Previous studies have documented the positive effects of mindfulness meditation on executive control. What has been lacking, however, is an understanding of the mechanism underlying this effect. Some theorists have described mindfulness as embodying two facets-present moment awareness and emotional acceptance. Here, we examine how the effect of meditation practice on executive control manifests in the brain, suggesting that emotional acceptance and performance monitoring play important roles. We investigated the effect of meditation practice on executive control and measured the neural correlates of performance monitoring, specifically, the error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological response that occurs within 100 ms of error commission. Meditators and controls completed a Stroop task, during which we recorded ERN amplitudes with electroencephalography. Meditators showed greater executive control (i.e. fewer errors), a higher ERN and more emotional acceptance than controls. Finally, mediation pathway models further revealed that meditation practice relates to greater executive control and that this effect can be accounted for by heightened emotional acceptance, and to a lesser extent, increased brain-based performance monitoring.},

Probably the most frequently used instrument is Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The simplified BDI (BDI-S) is a more efficient version of the BDI that has been shown to be no less reliable or valid. As the BDI-S has not yet been subjected to rigorous tests of Item Response Theory, it is the aim of the present paper to conduct such an analysis using the Rasch model. This study subjected a simplified version of the BDI consisting of 20 items (BDI-S20) to a Rasch analysis in a sample of N=5,035 participants. The scale, minus one misfitting item (BDI-S19), yielded a good approximation to Rasch assumptions. Moderate differential item functioning (DIF) was present. It is concluded that the BDI-S19 is an internally valid instrument for assessing depression, although some room for improvement exists.},

abstract = {The term working memory refers to a brain system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for such complex cognitive tasks as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning. This definition has evolved from the concept of a unitary short-term memory system. Working memory has been found to require the simultaneous storage and processing of information. It can be divided into the following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and (iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary.},

The mechanical method involves a formal, algorithmic, objective procedure (e.g., equation) to reach the decision. Empirical comparisons of the accuracy of the two methods (136 studies over a wide range of predictands) show that the mechanical method is almost invariably equal to or superior to the clinical method: Common antiactuarial arguments are rebutted, possible causes of widespread resistance to the comparative research are offered, and policy implications of the statistical method's superiority are discussed.},

@article{Steinhauer2004,
abstract = {The contributions of separate sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways to pupillary dilation during a sustained processing task were studied through environmental and pharmacological manipulations. In Experiment 1, 22 healthy volunteers (11 female) performed a serial Subtract 7 task while pupil diameter was recorded both during moderate room light and in darkness. In a control for verbalization, subjects performed an easier Add 1 task. In all conditions, pupil diameter increased significantly during the response period as compared to a pre-verbalization baseline period. Pupillary dilation was increased for the difficult task, and further increase in dilation was associated with recording in light. This suggests a major differential contribution to task difficulty mediated through inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway. In Experiment 2, a subgroup of 12 volunteers (seven female) repeated all conditions at three additional sessions in which one eye was instilled with tropicamide (to block the parasympathetic sphincter muscle), dapiprazole (to block the sympathetic dilator muscle) or placebo. All pharmacological conditions resulted in overall dilation during task performance. Differential performance similar to the placebo condition was seen only in the dapiprazole condition, when parasympathetic activation was intact. The findings suggest that sustained performance during a difficult task is modulated by cortical inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway at the oculomotor nucleus. Moreover, modulation of both ambient light intensity and pharmacological blockade of the final pupillary musculature were observed to provide converging approaches for quantifying the activity of identifiable central autonomic pathways.},

There were no significant changes between wait-list and pre-test,
except on the increase of teacher-rated ODD behavior. There was a
significant reduction of parent-rated ADHD behavior of themselves
and their child from pre-to posttest and from pre- to follow-up test.
Further, there was a significant increase of mindful awareness from
pre-to posttest and a significant reduction of parental stress and
overreactivity from pre-to follow-up test. Teacher-ratings showed
non-significant effects. Our study shows preliminary evidence for
the effectiveness of mindfulness for children with ADHD and their

abstract = {Purpose – This research sets about discovering if it is possible to identify distinct, practice-relevant and addressable clusters by means of selected criteria for constructing typologies – such as psychographic, culturally-specific and purchasing behaviour-relevant features – which permit an online supplier to efficiently and effectively focus on attractive consumer segments. Design/methodology/approach – To answer the research question, the study conducted an online survey with 1,011 participants. The respondents were from three countries, each with culturally-distinct features: France, Germany and the US. Underpinning the research are theoretically-secured constructs of purchasing behaviour on the internet. Findings – Cluster analysis confirmed the outstanding validity of a three-cluster-solution (97.7 per cent score) – risk-averse doubters, open-minded online shoppers, and reserved information-seekers. Discriminant analysis shows that certain constructs, particularly “neuroticism”, “willingness to buy” and “shopping pleasure”, separate the clusters best. Research limitations/implications – An extension of our clustering approach to more countries and especially non-western cultures promises interesting results. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to enlarge the catalogue of clustering variables to allow an even more specific fine-tuning of the main clusters identified in this research. Practical implications – The classification created provides the potential for a much closer fit between a company's goods and services and heterogeneous customer needs. Originality/value – The principal contribution of the paper is the identification of three different clusters of internet users. This can be of good use for shaping internet marketing, particularly by virtue of the likely stability over time from cultural and personality characteristics.},

No known studies have systematically reviewed and statistically integrated mediation studies in this field. The present study aimed to systematically review mediation studies in the literature on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), to identify potential psychological mechanisms underlying MBCT and MBSR's effects on psychological functioning and wellbeing, and evaluate the strength and consistency of evidence for each mechanism. For the identified mechanisms with sufficient evidence, quantitative synthesis using two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modelling (TSSEM) was used to examine whether these mechanisms mediate the impact of MBIs on clinical outcomes. This review identified strong, consistent evidence for cognitive and emotional reactivity, moderate and consistent evidence for mindfulness, rumination, and worry, and preliminary but insufficient evidence for self-compassion and psychological flexibility as mechanisms underlying MBIs. TSSEM demonstrated evidence for mindfulness, rumination and worry as significant mediators of the effects of MBIs on mental health outcomes. Most reviewed mediation studies have several key methodological shortcomings which preclude robust conclusions regarding mediation. However, they provide important groundwork on which future studies could build.},

Scales demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha varying from 0.81 to 0.93 for patients and from 0.88 to 0.96 for family members). MPOC-A domain scores were moderately correlated with CSQ total scores (Pearson coefficients varying from 0.44 to 0.66 for patients and from 0.53 to 0.72 for family members). Moderate to good inter-rater agreement [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from 0.50 to 0.74] and high test-retest reliability were found (ICCs varying from 0.73 to 0.83 for patients and from 0.75 to 0.91 for family members). CONCLUSIONS: MPOC-A has demonstrated good psychometric properties. As general satisfaction scores are notoriously poor indicators of the quality of care, this measure can help us understand the elements that contribute to overall judgements of satisfaction and provide a level of understanding that is important to improve service quality and delivery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome, is often accompanied by psychological distress and increased basal sympathetic tone. In a previous report it was shown that mindfulness-based stress-reduction (MBSR) reduced depressive symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia with gains maintained at two months follow-up (Sephton et al., Arthr Rheum 57:77-85, 2007). This second study explores the effects of MBSR on basal sympathetic (SNS) activation among women with fibromyalgia.

METHODS: Participants (n = 24) responded to a television news appearance, newspaper, and radio advertisements. Effects on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and SNS activation measures were tested before and after MBSR using a within-subjects design.

RESULTS: The MBSR treatment significantly reduced basal electrodermal (skin conductance level; SCL) activity (t = 3.298, p = .005) and SCL activity during meditation (t = 4.389, p = .001), consistent with reduced SNS activation.

CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample, basal SNS activity was reduced following MBSR treatment. Future studies should assess how MBSR may help reduce negative psychological symptoms and attenuate SNS activation in fibromyalgia. Further clarification of psychological and physiological responses associated with fibromyalgia may lead to more beneficial treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The ICF Core Set for stroke is an application of the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and represents
the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients with
stroke. AIM The aim of this study was to validate the ICF Core Set
for stroke from the perspective of physicians. DESIGN Observational.
SETTING Other. POPULATION Physicians experienced in stroke treatment.
METHODS Physicians experienced in stroke treatment were asked about
the patients' problems, patients' resources and aspects of environment
that physicians take care of in a three-round electronic mail survey
using the Delphi technique. The responses were linked to the ICF
by two persons. The degree of agreement was calculated using Kappa
statistic. RESULTS Eighty-eight physicians in 30 countries named
2142 patients' problems that covered all ICF components. Two hundred
seventy-seven ICF categories were linked to these. Kappa statistic
for agreement reached 0.68 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.66-0.69.
Although 28 ICF categories were not represented in the ICF Core Set
for stroke, only four of them were considered as important by at
least 75% of the participants. Those categories addressed sensations
associated with cardiovascular and respiratory functions, urinary
excretory functions, involuntary movement functions and sensations
related to muscle and movement functions. CONCLUSION The validity
of the ICF components Body structures, Activities and Participation,
and Environ-mental Factors was fully supported. Only some body functions
were identified that were not covered and need to be investigated
further.},

abstract = {Objectives. To assess whether talking or reading (silently or aloud) could affect heart rate variability (HRV) and to what extent these changes require a simultaneous recording of respiratory activity to be correctly interpreted. Background. Sympathetic predominance in the power spectrum obtained from short- and long-term HRV recordings predicts a poor prognosis in a number of cardiac diseases. Heart rate variability is often recorded without measuring respiration; slow breaths might artefactually increase low frequency power in RR interval (RR) and falsely mimic sympathetic activation. Methods. In 12 healthy volunteers we evaluated the effect of free talking and reading, silently and aloud, on respiration, RR and blood pressure (BP). We also compared spontaneous breathing to controlled breathing and mental arithmetic, silent or aloud. The power in the so called low-(LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands in RR and BP was obtained from autoregressive power spectrum analysis. Results. Compared with spontaneous breathing, reading silently increased the speed of breathing (p < 0.05), decreased mean RR and RR variability and increased BP. Reading aloud, free talking and mental arithmetic aloud shifted the respiratory frequency into the LF band, thus increasing LF% and decreasing HF% to a similar degree in both RR and respiration, with decrease in mean RR but with minor differences in crude RR variability. Conclusions. Simple mental and verbal activities markedly affect HRV through changes in respiratory frequency. This possibility should be taken into account when analyzing HRV without simultaneous acquisition and analysis of respiration. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.},

Based on self-efficacy theory and self-worth theory of achievement-motivation, it is hypothesized that the relationship between computer anxiety and job satisfaction is curvilinear and attitude towards computer moderates such relationship. The relationship between computer anxiety and career satisfaction and job stress were empirically examined in this study. Two hundred and thirty undergraduate students (125 female and 105 male students) at a university in south-western part of Louisiana completed computer anxiety, computer attitude, job satisfaction, career satisfaction and stress surveys. Hierarchical moderated regression results support that the attitude towards computer acts as a moderator in the relationship between (i) computer anxiety and stress, (ii) computer anxiety and job satisfaction, and (iii) computer anxiety and career satisfaction. Implications for management are discussed.},

abstract = {Innovative approaches are urgently needed to improve behavioral treatment
for weight loss. The weight regain that is so common after treatment
may be a result of an environment that makes it challenging to adhere,
long-term, to a dietary and physical activity regimen. This study
was designed to test, via a 12-week open trial, the preliminary feasibility,
acceptability, effectiveness, and possible mechanisms of action of
a behavioral treatment that was modified to incorporate acceptance-based
therapy components designed to (a) bolster participants' commitment
to behavior change, (b) build distress-tolerance skills, and (c)
promote mindful awareness of eating behaviors and goals. Participants
(n = 29) were overweight or obese women. Among completers (n = 19;
34% attrition), weight loss averaged 6.6% of body weight at posttreatment
and 9.6% at 6-month follow-up (n = 14; 52% attrition). Intention-to-treat
weight losses were 4.5% at posttreatment and 6.6% at 6-month follow-up.
Psychological variables targeted by the intervention (e.g., cognitive
restraint, disinhibition, urge-related eating behavior, emotional
eating, eating-related experiential acceptance, mindfulness and motivation)
changed in the expected directions, and many of these changes were
consistent with decreases in weight loss. Moreover, despite the limitations
of the single-group design, this pilot study demonstrated the preliminary
feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel, acceptance-based
behavioral treatment for obesity. One potential implication is that
behaviorally based weight loss interventions might be improved by
overlaying an acceptance-based framework.},

abstract = {The author conducted a partial replication of Stanley Milgram's (1963, 1965, 1974) obedience studies that allowed for useful comparisons with the original investigations while protecting the well-being of participants. Seventy adults participated in a replication of Milgram's Experiment 5 up to the point at which they first heard the learner's verbal protest (150 volts). Because 79% of Milgram's participants who went past this point continued to the end of the shock generator's range, reasonable estimates could be made about what the present participants would have done if allowed to continue. Obedience rates in the 2006 replication were only slightly lower than those Milgram found 45 years earlier. Contrary to expectation, participants who saw a confederate refuse the experimenter's instructions obeyed as often as those who saw no model. Men and women did not differ in their rates of obedience, but there was some evidence that individual differences in empathic concern and desire for control affected participants' responses.},

The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion. There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions. These ideas can account for a wide variety of research concerned with motivated reasoning.},

magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate changes in blood
oxygen level-dependent signal within the amygdala and subgenual AC
associated with trait neuroticism in a nonclinical sample of 36 volunteers
during an emotional conflict task. Neuroticism correlated positively
with amygdala and subgenual AC activation during trials of high emotional
conflict, compared with trials of low emotional conflict. The subscale
of neuroticism that reflected the anxious form of neuroticism (N1)
explained a greater proportion of variance within the observed clusters
than the subscale of neuroticism that reflected the depressive form
of neuroticism (N3). Using a task that is sensitive to individual
differences in the detection of emotional conflict, the authors have
provided a neural correlate of the link between neuroticism and anxiety
and mood disorders. This effect was driven to a greater extent by
the anxious relative to the depressive characteristics of neuroticism
and may constitute vulnerability markers for anxiety-related disorders.},

Salary level and promotion served as dependent measures of objective career success, and subjective career success was represented by career satisfaction. Results demonstrated that both objective and subjective career success were related to a wide range of predictors. As a group, human capital and sociodemographic predictors generally displayed stronger relationships with objective career success, and organizational sponsorship and stable individual differences were generally more strongly related to subjective career success. Gender and time (date of the study) moderated several of the relationships examined.

At polysomnography, 91 patients had SAHS (>15 apnoeas+hypopnoeas [A+H] per h asleep) and 11 had periodic limb-movement disorder. Recording sleep electrophysiologically was of no diagnostic value and SAHS could be as accurately defined by A + H per time in bed as by A + H per time asleep. 66% of patients with SAHS could bediagnosed with oximetryalone, but many of the undiagnosed patients had moderately severe SAHS and benefited from treatment. Neurophysiological sleep recording is unnecessary and oximetry alone is of limited value in the overnight investigation of patients suspected of having SAHS.},

abstract = {Cross-mapping the terms of International Classification for Nursing
Practice (ICNP) with the handwritten nursing records of gynecological
patients at one district of private teaching hospital in the south
of Taiwan was conducted in July and August, 2004. The purpose of
this study was to validate the applicability of ICNP for electronic
nursing records in a gynecological setting. A Chinese version of
the ICNP beta 2 browser was used to code nursing record sentences.
Medical charts were reviewed until data were saturated. A total of
sixty-two patient records were analyzed, producing 6,327 sentences,
this included 1,918 sentences on nursing phenomena (30.3%) and 4,409
sentences on nursing action (69.7%). The ratio between the two was
about 1:2.3. Coded sentences were compared according to the four
levels of applicability with the original records, each was identified
as a "perfect fit", "conceptual fit", "partial fit", or "unable to
fit". Of the 6,327 sentences, 2,041 (32.3%) were designated as "perfect
fit", 2,457 (38.8%) as "conceptual fit", 1,663 (26.3%) as "partial
fit", and 166 (2.6%) as "unable to fit". The top ten most described
nursing phenomena included: acute pain, high temperature, conscious
change, potential infection risk, state of mind change, potential
risk patient's mobility change endurance level, gastrointestinal
function obstacles, changes in urination, anxiety, and diarrhea.
The top ten most described nursing actions included: observe surgical
wounds, monitor vital signs, changes of mentality, instruction on
medication, arranging clinical check ups, wound infection prevention,
urinary drainage tube and urine nature observation, checking for
vaginal drainage, pre/post-operative healthcare, and discharge planning.
Study results indicated that 71.1% of sentences could be cross-mapped.
Further validation is suggested to validate ICNP in other gynecological
hospitals.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive method guidelines.

OBJECTIVES: To help reviewers design, conduct, and report reviews of trials in the field of back and neck pain.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In 1997, the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group published method guidelines for systematic reviews. Since its publication, new methodologic evidence emerged and more experience was acquired in conducting reviews.

METHODS: All reviews and protocols of the Back Review Group were assessed for compliance with the 1997 method guidelines. Also, the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook (4.1) was checked for new recommendations. In addition, some important topics that were not addressed in the 1997 method guidelines were included (e.g., methods for qualitative analysis, reporting of conclusions, and discussion of clinical relevance of the results). In May 2002, preliminary results were presented and discussed in a workshop. In two rounds, a list of all possible recommendations and the final draft were circulated for comments among the editors of the Back Review Group.

RESULTS: The recommendations are divided in five categories: literature search, inclusion criteria, methodologic quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis. Each recommendation is classified in minimum criteria and further guidance. Additional recommendations are included regarding assessment of clinical relevance, and reporting of results and conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews need to be conducted as carefully as the trials they report and, to achieve full impact, systematic reviews need to meet high methodologic standards.},

Studies using the emotional Stroop task yielded marginally significant
evidence of a difference between depressed and nondepressed samples,
whereas those using the dot probe task showed significant differences
between groups (d = 0.52). We found no evidence for significant moderation
of these effects by age, sex, type of depressed sample, year of publication,
stimulus presentation duration, or type of stimuli (verbal or nonverbal),
although statistical power for these tests was limited. These results
support the existence of biased attention to negative information

Functional analysis is tightly connected to treatment but has failed to develop testable, replicable classification systems. Functional diagnostic dimensions are suggested as a way to develop the functional classification approach, and experiential avoidance is described as 1 such dimension. A wide range of research is reviewed showing that many forms of psychopathology can be conceptualized as unhealthy efforts to escape and avoid emotions, thoughts, memories, and other private experiences. It is argued that experiential avoidance, as a functional diagnostic dimension, has the potential to integrate the efforts and findings of researchers from a wide variety of theoretical paradigms, research interests, and clinical domains and to lead to testable new approaches to the analysis and treatment of behavioral disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the needs and consequences of semi-customizing patient satisfaction surveys to low organizational levels and explored whether patient satisfaction was correlated with local organizational conditions.\n\nDESIGN: From 1999 to 2006, the County of Aarhus carried out 398 surveys during four rounds in eight hospitals. To explain differences between the wards, data on the 40 wards with the best and the 40 wards with the worst evaluations (identified by patient surveys) were compared with the data from job satisfaction surveys and management information systems.\n\nSETTING: Eight public hospitals in a Danish county.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: 32,809 inpatients and 1842 nurses on 84 wards.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Optimal organizational level for measuring patient satisfaction and correlations between overall patient satisfaction and organizational context.\n\nRESULTS: In all, 71.4% of the departments chose to have the survey results specified at the subunit level or for specific diagnostic groups. Substantial differences in patient satisfaction between wards are illustrated. On the wards with the highest improvement potential, we found significantly higher occupancy rates, acute rates, rates of sickness absenteeism, staff perceptions of high workload and low experience of professionalism.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that departments desired individual, detailed descriptions of the results. Differences in patient satisfaction were associated with differences in organizational conditions. Establishing a link between patient satisfaction and organizational variables broadens the quality development focus to include more than simply analysis of specific questions. Semi-customizing patient surveys are recommended.},

abstract = {<p><br/>Nurses have been slow to realise the uniqueness of their data
and the importance of data management across the profession. This
has resulted in nursing being neglected as a partner in healthcare
because the data nurses collect cannot be easily retrieved from the
patient record and is not widely used to support nursing practice.
Nurses, as they should, have rejected language classification systems
that are inadequate or inappropriate, but with the implementation
of electronic health records, consensus on language classification
must be achieved. One problem has been finding an appropriate terminology/s
that represents the spectrum of nursing practice while making sense
to both the user and computer. In 1989 the International Council
of Nurses began work to achieve this and the International Classification
for Nursing Practice (ICNP{\textregistered}) was born. This paper provides an insight
into language classification, explores the ICNP{\textregistered} as a tool for nursing
practice and discusses some of the projects undertaken thus far.</p>},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based clinical intervention program designed to reduce relapse or recurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) by means of systematic training in mindfulness meditation combined with cognitive-behavioral methods.

OBJECTIVE: By means of a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of MBCT for prevention of relapse or recurrence among patients with recurrent MDD in remission.

METHOD: Electronic databases were searched and researchers were contacted for further relevant studies. Studies were coded for quality. Meta-analyses were performed by means of the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager 5.1.

RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials with a total of 593 participants were included in the meta-analysis. MBCT significantly reduced the risk of relapse/recurrence with a risk ratio of 0.66 for MBCT compared to treatment as usual or placebo controls, corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 34%. In a pre-planned subgroup analysis the relative risk reduction was 43% for participants with three or more previous episodes, while no risk reduction was found for participants with only two episodes. In two studies, MBCT was at least as effective as maintenance antidepressant medication.

CONCLUSION: Results of this meta-analysis indicate that MBCT is an effective intervention for relapse prevention in patients with recurrent MDD in remission, at least in case of three or more previous MDD episodes.},

abstract = {Context Acupuncture is widely used to prevent migraine attacks, but the available
evidence of its benefit is scarce.Objective To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture
and with no acupuncture in patients with migraine.Design, Setting, and Patients Three-group, randomized, controlled trial (April 2002-January 2003)
involving 302 patients (88% women), mean (SD) age of 43 (11) years, with migraine
headaches, based on International Headache Society criteria. Patients were
treated at 18 outpatient centers in Germany.Interventions Acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or waiting list control. Acupuncture
and sham acupuncture were administered by specialized physicians and consisted
of 12 sessions per patient over 8 weeks. Patients completed headache diaries
from 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after randomization and from week 21 to 24
after randomization.Main Outcome Measures Difference in headache days of moderate or severe intensity between
the 4 weeks before and weeks 9 to 12 after randomization.Results Between baseline and weeks 9 to 12, the mean (SD) number of days with
headache of moderate or severe intensity decreased by 2.2 (2.7) days from
a baseline of 5.2 (2.5) days in the acupuncture group compared with a decrease
to 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.0 (2.4) days in the sham acupuncture
group, and by 0.8 (2.0) days from a baseline if 5.4 (3.0) days in the waiting
list group. No difference was detected between the acupuncture and the sham
acupuncture groups (0.0 days, 95% confidence interval, −0.7 to 0.7 days; P = .96) while there was a difference between
the acupuncture group compared with the waiting list group (1.4 days; 95%
confidence interval; 0.8-2.1 days; P<.001). The
proportion of responders (reduction in headache days by at least 50%) was
51% in the acupuncture group, 53% in the sham acupuncture group, and 15% in
the waiting list group.Conclusion Acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing
migraine headaches although both interventions were more effective than a
waiting list control.},

@article{Markle-Reid2006a,
abstract = {Despite the large potential role that community nurses have in providing individualized health promotion to older people, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding this role's effectiveness and efficiency. This article presents a literature review and synthesis of 12 randomized controlled trials selected from 344 published studies on preventive home visitation programs for older people. The findings suggest that a diversity of home visiting interventions carried out by nurses can favorably affect health and functional status, mortality rates, use of hospitalization and nursing homes, and costs. Further research is needed that focuses on the outcomes of quality of life, mental health, social support, caregiver burden, the acceptability of intervention, and specific subgroups of clients who benefit most. Findings also indicate the need for a theoretical foundation, increased emphasis on health-promotion strategies, and more research using a more complete economic evaluation to establish efficiency.

Each of 90 subjects had to pick the rectangles they liked best from all three ranges. This basic procedure was run under three different conditions: (a) subjects did not know the stimuli before, (b) subjects knew them from a foregoing psychophysical experiment, (c) the same, with reinforcing the golden section. The rectangles at both extremes of each range were chosen first most often under the first two conditions, whereas the golden section was chosen most often under the last condition. The conclusion is that preference for the golden section is an artifact of the stimulus range and of the demand characteristics of the experimental procedure rather than of any intrinsic aesthetic quality.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Nursing
Severity Index, a new method used to measure the admission severity
of illness of hospital patients using nursing diagnoses, which categorize
biologic, functional, cognitive, and psychosocial abnormalities.
This retrospective cohort study with independent development and
testing phases was conducted at a U.S. academic medical center. In
the development phase, data regarding 14,183 adult medical-surgical
patients admitted to the medical center in 1985 and 1986 was used.
In the testing phase, data regarding 7,302 patients admitted in 1987
and 1988 was used. Primary nurses prospectively recorded the presence
or absence of 61 nursing diagnoses on admission. Demographic and
clinical data were obtained from hospital data bases. In the development
phase, the number of admission nursing diagnoses was highly related
(P < 0.001) to in-hospital mortality. Using multiple logistic regression,
34 nursing diagnoses were identified as independent predictors of
mortality; the Nursing Severity Index equals the number of these
34 diagnoses. In the testing phase of 7,302 patients, the Nursing
Severity Index was related (P < 0.001) to mortality rates, which
were 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 6%, 13%, 22%, and 31% in seven hierarchical strata
defined by the Index. The Index was as accurate in predicting mortality
as MedisGroups (receiver-operating-characteristic curve areas, 0.814
± 0.016 vs. 0.845 ± 0.015, respectively, P = 0.12). Furthermore,
the Nursing Severity Index and MedisGroups together (receiver operating
caracteristic curve area 0.880 ± 0.014), were more accurate (P <
0.01) than either measure alone. The Nursing Severity Index assesses
multiple dimensions of illness, can be easily measured during rutine
patient care, accurately predicts the risk of in-hospital death,
and has similar prognostic accuracy as MedisGroups. Its usefulness
in outcomes assessment, quality assurance, and case management merits

The former relies on a static conception of information typically communicated in absolute language. Here, "facts" are given as truth, free of context or perspective. The latter relies on variability, communicated through condi-tional instruction. Here, facts are perspective dependent. Evidence is pre-sented that suggests that mindfulness is not only more effective, but is also more enjoyable. There is a pervasive belief in our culture that when there is "no pain" there is "no gain." To get acceptable grades in school, one has to endure the work of studying. To do well in a sport, one has to accept the importance of relentless practice. To master a musical instrument, one has to put up with tedious hours of playing scales.

abstract = {We integrate dual-process theories of human cognition with evolutionary game theory to study the evolution of automatic and controlled decision-making processes. We introduce a model where agents who make decisions using either automatic or controlled processing compete with each other for survival. Agents using automatic processing act quickly and so are more likely to acquire resources, but agents using controlled processing are better planners and so make more effective use of the resources they have. Using the replicator equation, we characterize the conditions under which automatic or controlled agents dominate, when coexistence is possible, and when bistability occurs. We then extend the replicator equation to consider feedback between the state of the population and the environment. Under conditions where having a greater proportion of controlled agents either enriches the environment or enhances the competitive advantage of automatic agents, we find that limit cycles can occur, leading to persistent oscillations in the population dynamics. Critically, however, these limit cycles only emerge when feedback occurs on a sufficiently long time scale. Our results shed light on the connection between evolution and human cognition, and demonstrate necessary conditions for the rise and fall of rationality.},

People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i.e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing that the answer is "yes" to the first two questions, and "no" to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, hit they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

The results show that the 4-point Likert-type formal response categories are not suitable for the scale. The distribution of the measures does not align with the distribution of the item measures in the original Grasmick et al. scale. The items do not fit the Rasch model, they do not form a unidimensional trait, and they function differently for males and females. Thus, the original Grasmick et al. scale does not have construct validity. A revised scale is presented that meets the standards of the Rasch model.},

This is a careful, thoughtful, article that quietly proceeds to outline the problems with current thinking and approaches to defining and using constructs in psychology. McGrath also suggests how some of these problems might be addressed. I note that McGrath appears to miss what might be considered an obvious rejoinder to some of his arguments, that is, the use of latent variable and item response theory. Some consideration is given to these arguments. However, a cursory examination shows that although these new methodologies offer many opportunities for new stochastic questionnaire data modeling and the construction of "instant" latent variables, the same problems caused by lack of attention to measurement and meaning remain. I find I am in agreement with many of the author's views and arguments, but I also find myself wondering whether modern psychometrics and individual differences research methods is now so dominated by psychological statisticians that any thought of substantive scientific innovation in this area that deals more properly with measurement and meaning is long gone. I think the answers to the question "What if there was no psychometrics?" would be most illuminating.},

abstract = {The essential character of what is classically considered, e.g., by N. R. Campbell, the fundamental measurement of extensive quantities is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) arbitrary combinations of “quantities” of a single specified kind. For example, the effect of placing one arbitrary combination of masses on a pan of a beam balance is compared with another arbitrary combination on the other pan. Measurement on a ratio scale follows from such axioms. In this paper, the essential character of simultaneous conjoint measurement is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) pairs formed from two specified kinds of “quantities”. The axioms apply when, for example, the effect of a pair consisting of one mass and one difference in gravitational potential on a device that responds to momentum is compared with the effect of another such pair. Measurement on interval scales which have a common unit follows from these axioms; usually these scales can be converted in a natural way into ratio scales.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The findings of epidemiological studies, diagnostic tests, and comparative therapeutic trials are often presented in 2 x 2 tables. These must be interpreted correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. METHODS: The authors present basic statistical concepts required for the analysis of nominal data, referring to standard works in statistics. RESULTS: The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two binary quantities (e.g., exposure--yes/no and disease--yes/no). The topics dealt with in this article include the effect of sample size on the length of the confidence interval and the p-value, and also inaccuracies caused by measuring error. Exposures are often expressed on a three-level scale (none, low, high). The authors also consider the 2 x 3 table as an extension of the 2 x 2 table and discuss the categorization of continuous measurements. Typically, more than one factor is involved in the development of a disease. The effect that a further factor can have on the observed relationship between the exposure and the disease is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Sample size, measurement error, categorization, and confounders influence the statistical interpretation of 2 x 2 tables in many ways. Readers of scientific publications should know the inherent problems in the interpretation of simple 2 x 2 tables and check that the authors have taken these into account adequately in analyzing and interpreting their data.},

abstract = {Previous work on the aesthetics of simple figures such as rectangles and triangles, as well as on the aesthetics of color, suggests that although there are clear population level preferences, there are also large individual differences which are temporally stable, and which any adequate theoretical analysis must take into account. Data presented here show similar phenomena in a related problem in composition—where to place an object within the frame of a picture to produce the optimal aesthetic effect. A novel and powerful "method of randomized paired comparisons" first showed that there are overall population level preferences, with objects being placed preferentially at the two golden sections horizontally, and between the two golden sections vertically. As in the studies of simple figures and colors, there are large individual differences. A cognitive model of "sensory aesthetics" is proposed in which continua of any type (space, geometric objects, colors, or whatever), are described categorically, usually in terms of words such as "square," "rectangle," "line," etc., each of which is a fuzzy set. Preference functions are then derived from the union and intersection of the fuzzy set functions, which differ between individuals as their categories differ or as they prefer objects which are prototypical, or are at the boundaries between prototypes. There is therefore wide inter-individual variability.},

abstract = {Improvements in attentional performance are at the core of proposed
mechanisms for stress reduction in mindfulness meditation practices.
However, this claim can be questioned because no previous studies
have actively manipulated test effort in control groups and controlled
for effects of stress reduction per se. In a blinded design, 48 young,
healthy meditation novices were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based
stress reduction (MBSR), nonmindfulness stress reduction (NMSR),
or inactive control group. At posttest, inactive controls were randomly
split into nonincentive and incentive controls, the latter receiving
a financial reward to improve attentional performance. Pre- and postintervention,
5 validated attention paradigms were employed along with self-report
scales on mindfulness and perceived stress and saliva cortisol samples
to measure physiological stress. Attentional effects of MBSR, NMSR,
and the financial incentive were comparable or significantly larger
in the incentive group on all reaction-time-based measures. However,
selective attention in the MBSR group improved significantly more
than in any other group. Similarly, only the MBSR intervention improved
the threshold for conscious perception and visual working memory
capacity. Furthermore, stress-reducing effects of MBSR were supported
because those in the MBSR group showed significantly less perceived
and physiological stress while increasing their mindfulness levels
significantly. We argue that MBSR may contribute uniquely to attentional
improvements but that further research focusing on non-reaction-time-based
measures and outcomes less confounded by test effort is needed. Critically,
our data demonstrate that previously observed improvements of attention
after MBSR may be seriously confounded by test effort and nonmindfulness
stress reduction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights

and to report the effects of nursing diagnostics implementation.
This paper summarizes the results of six studies. METHODS Two systematic
reviews, instrument development and testing, a pre-post intervention
study, and a cluster-randomized trial were performed. FINDINGS The
NANDA International classification met most of the literature-based
classification criteria, and results showed the Quality of Nursing
Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes (Q-DIO) to be a reliable instrument
to measure the documented quality of nursing diagnoses, interventions,
and outcomes. Implementation of standardized nursing language significantly
improved the quality of documented nursing diagnoses, related interventions,
and patient outcomes. As a follow-up measure, Guided Clinical Reasoning
(GCR) was effective in supporting nurses' clinical reasoning skills.
CONCLUSIONS Carefully implementing classifications led to enhanced,
accurately stated nursing diagnoses, more effective nursing interventions,
and better patient outcomes. IMPLICATIONS Rethinking implementation
methods for standardized language and using GCR is recommended. Based
on the results of this study, the inclusion of NANDA International
diagnoses with related interventions and outcomes in electronic health
records is suggested.},

abstract = {One hundred sixty-three men who have been followed prospectively for over 45 years were rated on a set of 25 personality traits at the end of their college careers and took the NEO-PI at approximately ages 67–68. The college traits were transformed, via a rating procedure, to scales assessing each of the Big Five dimensions and related to the NEO-PI. Three traits—Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness—exhibited significant correlations across the 45-year interval. Furthermore, the trait profiles remained relatively stable over that interval. Both sets of personality traits were related to a wide variety of life course variables representing the domains of global adult adjustment, career functioning/success, creativity, social relations, mental health, substance abuse, childhood characteristics, familial history of pathology, maturity of defenses, and political attitudes. Conscientiousness in college was the best predictor of what happened to the men in the future, whereas Neuroticism in late midlife was the best correlate of life course functioning across a variety of domains.},

Here we present the circlize package, which provides an implementation of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available software. The flexibility of this package is based on the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R, circlize gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding genomic patterns behind multi-dimensional data. Availability and implementation: circlize is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circlize/ CONTACT: b.brors@dkfz.de Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Context Primary care physicians report high levels of distress, which
is linked to burnout, attrition, and poorer quality of care. Programs
to reduce burnout before it results in impairment are rare; data
on these programs are scarce.Objective To determine whether an intensive
educational program in mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness
is associated with improvement in primary care physicians' well-being,
psychological distress, burnout, and capacity for relating to patients.Design,
Setting, and Participants Before-and-after study of 70 primary care
physicians in Rochester, New York, in a continuing medical education
(CME) course in 2007-2008. The course included mindfulness meditation,
self-awareness exercises, narratives about meaningful clinical experiences,
appreciative interviews, didactic material, and discussion. An 8-week
intensive phase (2.5 h/wk, 7-hour retreat) was followed by a 10-month
maintenance phase (2.5 h/mo).Main Outcome Measures Mindfulness (2
subscales), burnout (3 subscales), empathy (3 subscales), psychosocial
orientation, personality (5 factors), and mood (6 subscales) measured
at baseline and at 2, 12, and 15 months.Results Over the course of
the program and follow-up, participants demonstrated improvements
in mindfulness (raw score, 45.2 to 54.1; raw score change [$\Delta$], 8.9;
95% confidence interval [CI], 7.0 to 10.8); burnout (emotional exhaustion,
26.8 to 20.0; $\Delta$ = −6.8; 95% CI, −4.8 to −8.8; depersonalization,
8.4 to 5.9; $\Delta$ = −2.5; 95% CI, −1.4 to −3.6; and personal
accomplishment, 40.2 to 42.6; $\Delta$ = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.6); empathy
(116.6 to 121.2; $\Delta$ = 4.6; 95% CI, 2.2 to 7.0); physician belief
scale (76.7 to 72.6; $\Delta$ = −4.1; 95% CI, −1.8 to −6.4); total
mood disturbance (33.2 to 16.1; $\Delta$ = −17.1; 95% CI, −11 to
−23.2), and personality (conscientiousness, 6.5 to 6.8; $\Delta$ = 0.3;
95% CI, 0.1 to 5 and emotional stability, 6.1 to 6.6; $\Delta$ = 0.5;
95% CI, 0.3 to 0.7). Improvements in mindfulness were correlated
with improvements in total mood disturbance (r = −0.39, P < .001),
perspective taking subscale of physician empathy (r = 0.31, P < .001),
burnout (emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment subscales,
r = −0.32 and 0.33, respectively; P < .001), and personality
factors (conscientiousness and emotional stability, r = 0.29 and
0.25, respectively; P < .001).Conclusions Participation in a mindful
communication program was associated with short-term and sustained
improvements in well-being and attitudes associated with patient-centered
care. Because before-and-after designs limit inferences about intervention
effects, these findings warrant randomized trials involving a variety
of practicing physicians.},

abstract = {Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that strongly relates to a person's ability to reason with novel information and direct attention to goal-relevant information. Due to the central role that WM plays in general cognition, it has become the focus of a rapidly growing training literature that seeks to affect broad cognitive change through prolonged training on WM tasks. Recent work has suggested that the effects of WM training extend to general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and reductions in symptoms of ADHD. We present a theoretically motivated perspective of WM and subsequently review the WM training literature in light of several concerns. These include (a) the tendency for researchers to define change to abilities using single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of valid WM tasks, (c) no-contact control groups, and (d) subjective measurement of change. The literature review highlights several findings that warrant further research but ultimately concludes that there is a need to directly demonstrate that WM capacity increases in response to training. Specifically, we argue that transfer of training to WM must be demonstrated using a wider variety of tasks, thus eliminating the possibility that results can be explained by task specific learning. Additionally, we express concern that many of the most promising results (e.g., increased intelligence) cannot be readily attributed to changes in WM capacity. Thus, a critical goal for future research is to uncover the mechanisms that lead to transfer of training. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {For a given physical duration, certain events can be experienced as
subjectively longer in duration than others. Try this for yourself:
take a quick glance at the second hand of a clock. Immediately, the
tick will pause momentarily and appear to be longer than the subsequent
ticks. Yet, they all last exactly one second. By and large, a deviant
or an unexpected stimulus in a series of similar events (same duration,
same features) can elicit a relative overestimation of subjective
time (or "time dilation") but, as is shown here, this is
not always the case. We conducted an event-related functional magnetic
neuroimaging (fMRI) study on the time dilation effect. Participants
were presented with a series of five visual discs, all static and
of equal duration (standards) except for the fourth one, a looming
or a receding target. The duration of the target was systematically
varied and participants judged whether it was shorter or longer than
all other standards in the sequence. Subjective time dilation was
observed for the looming stimulus but not for the receding one, which
was estimated to be of equal duration to the standards. The neural
activation for targets (looming and receding) contrasted with the
standards revealed an increased activation of the anterior insula
and of the anterior cingulate cortex. Contrasting the looming with
the receding targets (i.e. capturing the time dilation effect proper)
revealed a specific activation of cortical midline structures. The
implication of midline structures in the time dilation illusion is
here interpreted in the context of self-referential processes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a concise scale for measuring outpatient satisfaction suitable across specialties and cultures. DESIGN: & SETTING: Item generation adopted a concept-driven approach, and 10 candidate items were administered together with a battery of validation items and scales in a cross-sectional survey at a government-aided Chinese medicine specialized outpatient department in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: About 344 consenting patients or their accompanying caregivers were recruited upon their first visit at the clinic and interviewed one month thereafter. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 79%. After deleting one item (physician's manner and attitude) for its redundancy suggested by interitem correlations, exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors, General Service and Case Physician, explaining 75% of variance of the remaining nine items. The internal consistency coefficients of the whole scale and the two subscales were higher than 0.90. Criterion-related validity was supported by high correlations with three anchor items, overall satisfaction, intended future reutilization, and recommendation to others (r = 0.38-0.85). Significant correlations with compliance and negative affects provided preliminary evidence for construct validity. CONCLUSION: The psychometric properties of the resulting 9-item scale supported its usefulness in measuring outpatient satisfaction. Further validation studies in various specialties and countries are suggested to make future cross-cultural comparisons possible.},

abstract = {SentimentWortschatz, or SentiWS for short, is a publicly available German-language resource for sentiment analysis, opinion mining etc. It lists positive and negative sentiment bearing words weighted within the interval of [−1; 1] plus their part of speech tag, and if applicable, their inflections. The current version of SentiWS (v1.8b) contains 1,650 negative and 1,818 positive words, which sum up to 16,406 positive and 16,328 negative word forms, respectively. It not only contains adjectives and adverbs explicitly expressing a sentiment, but also nouns and verbs implicitly containing one. The present work describes the resource's structure, the three sources utilised to assemble it and the semi-supervised method incorporated to weight the strength of its entries. Furthermore the resource's contents are extensively evaluated using a German-language evaluation set we constructed. The evaluation set is verified being reliable and its shown that SentiWS provides a beneficial lexical resource for German-language sentiment analysis related tasks to build on.},

To this end, we present a provisional list of 50 commonly used terms in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields that should be avoided, or at most used sparingly and with explicit caveats. We provide corrective information for students, instructors, and researchers regarding these terms, which we organize for expository purposes into five categories: inaccurate or misleading terms, frequently misused terms, ambiguous terms, oxymorons, and pleonasms. For each term, we (a) explain why it is problematic, (b) delineate one or more examples of its misuse, and (c) when pertinent, offer recommendations for preferable terms. By being more judicious in their use of terminology, psychologists and psychiatrists can foster clearer thinking in their students and the field at large regarding mental phenomena.      },

abstract = {Whereas the number of studies supporting the efficacy of mindfulness as a health intervention is increasing, the measurement of mindfulness remains a subject of debate. Given the importance of measurement in this field, this paper aims to further our understanding of the assessment of mindfulness by employing an approach referred to as “random forests” (RF). RF is an ensemble learning method that is based on decision trees. RF is well known in biological research, for example, but is practically unknown in psychometrics. In this study, RF was used to gauge the predictive validity of the items from two mindfulness instruments concerning their ability to estimate group allocation (i.e., mindfulness practitioners vs. nonpractitioners). To allow for a better generalization of the results, we examined the research questions in two samples (N=76 and N=202) of different quality. We investigated two instruments: the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale. Although results indicated that both instruments were capable of distinguishing practitioners from nonpractitioners, the predictive quality of most items on both scales was determined to be insufficient.},

In the ten years since publication of the first edition of this bestselling text, great strides have been made in the development of new methods and in software for generalized linear models and other closely related models.Thoroughly revised and updated, An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition continues to initiate intermediate students of statistics, and the many other disciplines that use statistics, in the practical use of these models and methods. The new edition incorporates many of the important developments of the last decade, including survival analysis, nominal and ordinal logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, and multi-level models. It also includes modern methods for checking model adequacy and examples from an even wider range of application.Statistics can appear to the uninitiated as a collection of unrelated tools. An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition illustrates how these apparently disparate methods are examples or special cases of a conceptually simple structure based on the exponential family of distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, and the principles of statistical modelling.},

abstract = {Confusion over the reporting and interpretation of results of commonly employed classical statistical tests is recorded in a sample of 1,645 papers from 12 psychology journals for the period 1990 through 2002. The confusion arises because researchers mistakenly believe that their interpretation is guided by a single unified theory of statistical inference. But this is not so: classical statistical testing is a nameless amalgamation of the rival and often contradictory approaches developed by Ronald Fisher, on the one hand, and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, on the other. In particular, there is extensive failure to acknowledge the incompatibility of Fisher's evidential pvalue with the Type I error rate, •, of Neyman–Pearson statistical orthodoxy. The distinction between evidence (p's) and errors (•'s) is not trivial. Rather, it reveals the basic differences underlying Fisher's ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman–Pearson views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior. So complete is this misunderstanding over measures of evidence versus error that it is not viewed as even being a problem among the vast majority of researchers and other relevant parties. These include the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference, and those writing the guidelines concerning statistical testing mandated in APA Publication Manuals. The result is that, despite supplanting Fisher's significance-testing paradigm some fifty years or so ago, recognizable applications of Neyman–Pearson theory are few and far between in psychology's empirical literature. On the other hand, Fisher's influence is ubiquitous.},

abstract = {The aims of this randomised controlled trial were to determine if
a high-intensity functional exercise program improves balance, gait
ability, and lower-limb strength in older persons dependent in activities
of daily living and if an intake of protein-enriched energy supplement
immediately after the exercises increases the effects of the training.
One hundred and ninety-one older persons dependent in activities
of daily living, living in residential care facilities, and with
a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ? 10 participated.
They were randomised to a high-intensity functional exercise program
or a control activity, which included 29 sessions over 3 months,
as well as to protein-enriched energy supplement or placebo. Berg
Balance Scale, self-paced and maximum gait speed, and one-repetition
maximum in lower-limb strength were followed-up at three and six
months and analysed by 2 x 2 factorial ANCOVA, using the intention-to-treat
principle. At three months, the exercise group had improved significantly
in self-paced gait speed compared with the control group (mean difference
0.04 m/s, p = 0.02). At six months, there were significant improvements
favouring the exercise group for Berg Balance Scale (1.9 points,
p = 0.05), self-paced gait speed (0.05 m/s, p = 0.009), and lower-limb
strength (10.8 kg, p = 0.03). No interaction effects were seen between
the exercise and nutrition interventions. In conclusion, a high-intensity
functional exercise program has positive long-term effects in balance,
gait ability, and lower-limb strength for older persons dependent
in activities of daily living. An intake of protein-enriched energy
supplement immediately after the exercises does not appear to increase
the effects of the training.},

The spontaneous, creative, mindful use of previously learned information, however, tends to be atypical. Three studies were designed to assess whether the manner in which information is initially presented affects how such information will subsequently be used, that is, in a mindful or mindless way. More specifically, two experiments (one with children, the other with college students) were conducted to compare the effects of a conditional versus absolute form of teaching upon creativity. Results revealed that instruction presented in an absolute manner resulted in mindless use of the information for both age groups. In contrast, subjects who were taught in a conditional way were better able to creatively deal with the information. For the college students, this finding was obtained even when the absolute learning condition was concerned with theoretical (i.e., conditional) information. In a third experiment, student teachers were taught conditionally or unconditionally in a confident or unconfident manner. Results indicated that confident but conditional instruction was most effective in provoking subsequent mindfulness.},

@article{Antoniotti2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a generic French self-administered instrument for measuring hospitalized patients' satisfaction based on the patient's point of view: the questionnaire for satisfaction of hospitalized (QSH) patients. DESIGN: The development was supervised by a steering committee and undertaken through three standard steps. Item generation was derived from 95 face-to-face interviews, performed in hospitalized patients and in patients scheduled to be admitted. The item reduction led to a 69-item questionnaire. The validation process was based on validity, reliability and some aspects of external validity. SETTING: Medical, surgical and obstetrical departments (n = 187) of public hospitals (n = 11) from different French regions (n = 3). PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients were adult subjects hospitalized for at least 24 h. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QSH, sociodemographic data, hospitalization department, visual analogue scales of satisfaction. RESULTS: The final version of QSH contained 45 items describing 9 dimensions, leading to 2 composite scores (staff and structure index). The factor structure accounted for 71% of the total variance. Internal consistency was satisfactory (item-internal consistency over 0.40; Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 0.96). The scalability was satisfactory with inlier-sensitive fit (INFIT) statistics inside an acceptable range. Scores of dimensions were strongly positively correlated with visual analogue scale scores (all P < 0.001). External validity showed statistical associations between QSH scores and age or department. Participation rate was 91%. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of a reliable and valid French questionnaire concerning hospitalized patients' satisfaction, exclusively generated from patients' interviews, enables patient feedback to be incorporated in a continuous quality health-care improvement strategy.},

Nurses and nursing support staff increasingly require computers to carry out their work. Minimum computer competencies for nurses have been identified. The determination of whether the current nursing workforce has acquired these competencies remains uncertain. We administered a self-assessment survey to nurses and nursing support staff to determine proficiency with computer skills they might perform at work. Respondents reported inadequacies in basic and work-related computer skills. More than 28% scored themselves as having fair or poor proficiency on all skills, and more than 50% as fair or poor on five of 11 skills. Respondents over age 50 and those graduating before 1984 tended to score proficiency lower. Our study suggests that many nurses and nursing support staff may not have the minimum computer competencies to effectively and efficiently perform their work.},

On the basis of an interactionist principle of trait activation (R. P. Tett & H. A.

Trait-expressive work behavior is distinguished from (valued) job performance in clarifying the conditions favoring personality use in selection efforts. The model frames linkages between situational taxonomies (e.g., J. L. Holland's [1985] RIASEC model) and the Big Five and promotes useful discussion of critical issues, including situational specificity, personality-oriented job analysis, team building, and work motivation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in improving stress, depression and anxiety in breast cancer patients.

METHODS: An extensive systematic electronic review (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsyArticles, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library) and a hand search were carried out from 15 October 2011 to 30 November 2011 to retrieve relevant articles using 'mindfulness' or 'mindfulness-based stress reduction' and 'breast cancer' as keywords. Information about the baseline characteristics of the participants, interventions and findings on perceived stress, depression and anxiety was extracted from each study.

RESULTS: Nine published studies (two randomised controlled trials, one quasi-experimental case-control study and six one-group, pre-intervention and post-intervention studies) up to November 2011 that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were analysed. The pooled effect size (95% CI) for MBSR on stress was 0.710 (0.511-0.909), on depression was 0.575 (0.429-0.722) and on anxiety was 0.733 (0.450-1.017).

CONCLUSION: On the basis of these findings, MBSR shows a moderate to large positive effect size on the mental health of breast cancer patients and warrants further systematic investigation because it has a potential to make a significant improvement on mental health for women in this group.},

Using insights derived from self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987), we explore the social category relations among those present in the context of physical violence. The paper describes two experiments that manipulate the social category relations between (a) bystander and fellow bystanders, and (b) bystander and victim. Analysis indicates that fellow bystanders are only influential when they are in-group rather than out-group members. Furthermore, bystanders are more likely to help victims who are described as in-group as opposed to out-group members. Overall, the findings suggest an important role for a self-categorization perspective in developing strategies to promote bystander intervention.},

In Experiment 2, making a meaningful personal choice to perform attitude-relevant behavior caused a similar decrement in persistence. In Experiment 3, suppressing emotion led to a subsequent drop in performance of solvable anagrams. In Experiment 4, an initial task requiring high self-regulation made people more passive (i.e., more prone to favor the passive-response option).

abstract = {Purpose. This review provides an overview of the literature on the
conceptualisation of the Personal Factors (PF) component of the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Method. A
systematic literature review was carried out. Electronic searches
were performed in Pubmed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and SSCI. Qualitative
content analysis of statements about PF was conducted using inductive
coding. Results. The searches yielded 353 citations, 79 papers
were eligible for analyses. Five hundred thirty-eight statements
about PF were extracted, condensed and coded. Beside conceptual statements,
238 examples of potential PF as well as five attempts at classifying
PF were found in the literature. PF were considered in relation to
clinical service provision, assessment and intervention, in research
and social security contexts. PF were seen to be related to various
aspects of health, functioning, disability and the environment. Conclusions. The
analysis of the literature shows that PF is seen as relevant to the
application of the ICF in various settings. The review revealed a
need for standardisation of PF. The literature points to the potential
of PF in enhancing the understanding of functioning, disability and
health, in facilitating interventions and services for people with
disabilities, and strengthening the perspective of individuals in
the ICF.},

In the past several years, enormous progress has been made in developing tools and methods, and the community has been witness to some exciting developments. Although the state of the community is regularly reviewed, the sheer volume of work related to biomedical text mining and the rapid pace in which progress continues to be made make this a worthwhile, if not necessary, endeavor. This chapter provides a brief overview of the current state of text mining in the biomedical domain. Emphasis is placed on the resources and tools available to biomedical researchers and practitioners, as well as the major text mining tasks of interest to the community. These tasks include the recognition of explicit facts from biomedical literature, the discovery of previously unknown or implicit facts, document summarization, and question answering. For each topic, its basic challenges and methods are outlined and recent and influential work is reviewed.},

In dieser Wettbewerbssituation verlieren die meisten Industrienationen t{\"{a}}glich Arbeitspl{\"{a}}tze, und zwar einfache wie komplexe, an so genannte Niedriglohnl{\"{a}}nder, wie z.B. die osteurop{\"{a}}ischen Staaten, aber auch Indien, China etc. In Deutschland wanderten beispielsweise allein im Jahr 2003 pro Tag 1700 Arbeitspl{\"{a}}tze in diese L{\"{a}}nder ab. Insgesamt hat dies in Deutschland im Zeitraum von 1991 bis 2004 zu einem Verlust von nahezu zwei Millionen industriellen Arbeitspl{\"{a}}tzen gef{\"{u}}hrt. Dabei haben die Reduzierung von Personal und die Optimierung organisationsinterner Prozesse in den 90er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts oft nicht den gew{\"{u}}nschten wirtschaftlichen Erfolg erzielt (Hamel & Prahalad, 1994).

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a prospective study testing an expanded theory of reasoned action (TRA) to predict mammography participation. A questionnaire was developed to measure each of the expanded TRA model components. A sample was identified of 946 women age 40 and above who were invited to obtain a mammogram at the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP). The sample was stratified by risk category as determined by the screening program. The study questionnaire was administered to all women in the sample within 2 weeks after they were sent the invitation to obtain a mammogram. Mammography participation was obtained from the BCSP data base 6 months after the invitation. Regression analyses found attitude, affect, subjective norm, and facilitating conditions to all be significantly associated with participation. The expanded TRA model explained 39% of the variance in women's intentions and 20% of the variance in participation behavior. A stepwise hierarchical regression found that no other psychosocial measures were able to improve the model predictions of behavior. An interaction between habit and intention was found such that women with larger numbers of previous mammograms were less likely to carry out their intentions than women with fewer previous mammograms. Contrary to expectations, some demographic characteristics did significantly improve prediction. The need for further work investigating the roles of fear and experience is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Satisfaction is considered a valuable measure of outcome of healthcare processes. Only a few anesthesia-related validated questionnaires are reported. Because their scope is restricted to specific clinical contexts, their use remains limited. The objective of the current study was to develop and validate a self-reported questionnaire, Evaluation du Vecu de l'Anesthesie Generale (EVAN-G), assessing the satisfaction of the perioperative period surrounding general anesthesia. METHODS: Development of the EVAN-G questionnaire comprised a phase of item generation and a phase of psychometric validation. The patient sample was generated to be proportionally matched to the population of patients undergoing general anesthesia in France. The structure of the questionnaire was identified studying interitem, item-dimension, and interdimension correlations and factor analyses. Data were concurrently gathered to assess external validity. The discriminant validity was determined by comparison of scores across well known patient groups. Reliability was assessed by computation of Cronbach alpha coefficients and by test-retest. RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-four patients were recruited in eight anesthesia departments. The EVAN-G includes 26 items; six specific scores and one global index score are available. Correlations between EVAN-G scores and other concurrent measures supported convergent validity. The EVAN-G correlated poorly with age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, total anesthesia time, and number of previous anesthesias. Significantly higher satisfaction was reported by patients older than 65 yr, belonging to the laryngeal mask group. Reliability and reproducibility were shown. CONCLUSION: The EVAN-G adds important information oriented toward patients' perceptions. The authors' approach provides a novel, valid, and reliable tool that may be used in anesthesia practice.},

abstract = {Element distribution in the bark of two 20-year-old clones of Picea sitchensis following wounding was studied using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Bark was sampled at 0, 3, and 43 days after wounding and analysed using a focused Nd:YAG laser (266 nm). Intensities of (13) C, (25)Mg, (27)Al, (31)P, (32)S, (39)K, (48)Ca, (55)Mn, (57)Fe, (63)Cu and (64)Zn were measured by ICP-MS to study elemental distribution across the bark samples during the wound repair process. A clear accumulation of Mg, P and K at the boundary zone between the lesion and healthy tissue was detected in the wounded samples and was more distinctive at 43 than at 3 days after treatment. This zone of accumulation mapped onto the position of formation of the ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiation of the wound periderm. These accumulations suggest major roles for Mg, P and K in the non-specific response of Sitka spruce both to wounding, possibly as co-factors to enzymes and energy utilisation. The LA-ICP-MS method developed in this work proved useful to study spatial element distribution across bark samples and has great potential for applications in other areas of plant pathology research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although patient safety climate is an important factor in preventing adverse events in health care organizations, there is no usable Japanese scale. OBJECTIVE: To develop a Japanese scale to measure patient safety climate and to evaluate its psychometric properties. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with respect to 9 non-academic general hospitals in Japan. A total of 1878 health care professionals (nurses, therapists, technicians, pharmacists and physicians) were included in a study. RESULTS: The eight dimensions measuring worker attitudes (free communication flow, continuous improvement, reporting/rules compliance and patient/family involvement) and organizational factors (supervisors' safety leadership, allied professionals' safety leadership, patient safety committee leadership and rules/equipment availability) were extracted by factor analysis. The internal consistency (measured by Cronbach's alpha) and repeatability (measured by intraclass correlation) were more than 0.70 for all subscales. In addition, the mean score, the within-group interrater reliability statistic (r(wg)) and the correlation coefficients of the mean score were confirmed at the workplace level. CONCLUSIONS: The scale showed acceptable dimensionality, reliability and validity. It also provided workplace team-evaluation and a tool for assessing the patient safety climate at the level of the workplace.},

abstract = {Mindfulness has been proposed as a useful adjunct to alcohol abuse
treatment. However, very little research has examined the basic relationship
between alcohol use and mindfulness. Inconsistency in definition
and measurement of mindfulness across studies makes such research
difficult to interpret and conduct. Therefore, the current research
sought to validate an emerging mindfulness measure, the Five Facet
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and examine its relationship with
alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences among a sample
of 316 college-aged adults. The purported factor structure of the
FFMQ was examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Structural
equation modeling was used to examine relations among mindfulness,
alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences. Consistent
with past research, results supported the five-factor structure of
the FFMQ. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that two
awareness-based factors of mindfulness were negatively related to
alcohol use. After controlling for alcohol use, one acceptance-based
factor (nonjudging of thoughts and feelings) was negatively related
to alcohol-related consequences, and one awareness-based factor was
positively related to consequences (all ps < .05). Effect sizes were
small-medium. The results reported here inform the burgeoning development
of mindfulness-based addiction treatment and provide additional psychometric
validation of the FFMQ.},

The growing use of activity-based monitoring (actigraphy) in sleep medicine and sleep research has enriched and challenged traditional sleep-monitoring techniques. This review summarizes the empirical data on the validity of actigraphy in assessing sleep-wake patterns and assessing clinical and control groups ranging in age from infancy to elderly. An overview of sleep-related actigraphic studies is also included. Actigraphy provides useful measures of sleep-wake schedule and sleep quality. The data also suggest that actigraphy, despite its limitations, may be a useful, cost-effective method for assessing specific sleep disorders, such as insomnia and schedule disorders, and for monitoring their treatment process. Methodological issues such as the proper use of actigraphy and possible artifacts have not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice.},

The emphasis is laid on psychological and neurobiological approaches. The phenomenological analysis of the multiple ASC resulted in 4 dimensions by which they can be characterized: activation, awareness span, self-awareness, and sensory dynamics. The neurophysiological approach revealed that the different states of consciousness are mainly brought about by a compromised brain structure, transient changes in brain dynamics (disconnectivity), and neurochemical and metabolic processes. Besides these severe alterations, environmental stimuli, mental practices, and techniques of self-control can also temporarily alter brain functioning and conscious experience.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge concerning the applicability and
the effect of high-intensity exercise programs is very limited for
older people with severe cognitive and physical impairments. The
primary aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a
high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program among older
people who are dependent in activities of daily living and living
in residential care facilities. A second aim was to analyze whether
cognitive function was associated with the applicability of the program.
SUBJECTS: The subjects were 91 older people (mean age=85.3 years,
SD=6.1, range=68-100) who were dependent in personal activities of
daily living and randomly assigned to participate in an exercise
intervention. Their mean score for the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) was 17.5 (SD=5.0, range=10-29). METHODS: A high-intensity
functional weight-bearing exercise program was performed in groups
of 3 to 7 participants who were supervised by physical therapists.
There were 29 exercise sessions over 13 weeks. Attendance, intensity
of lower-limb strength and balance exercises, and occurrence and
seriousness of adverse events were the outcome variables in evaluating
the applicability of the program. RESULTS: The median attendance
rate was 76%. Lower-limb strength exercises with high intensity were
performed in a median of 53% of the attended exercise sessions, and
balance exercises with high intensity were performed in a median
of 73% of the attended exercise sessions. The median rate of sessions
with adverse events was 5%. All except 2 adverse events were assessed
as minor and temporary, and none led to manifest injury or disease.
No significant differences were observed in applicability when comparing
participants with dementia and participants without dementia. In
addition, there was no significant correlation between applicability
and the MMSE score. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results suggest
that a high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program
is applicable for use, regardless of cognitive function, among older
people who are dependent in activities of daily living, living in
residential care facilities, and have an MMSE score of 10 or higher.},

abstract = {Despite its 55 year presence in the field of mathematical psychology, the theory of unidimensional unfolding remains an enigma for many psychometricians and applied practitioners. This paper is the first of a three part series; and it aims to introduce unidimensional unfolding theory. The paper begins with a simple hypothetical example presenting an idealised distinction between responses to cumulative and unfolding dichotomous items. This followed by an accessible presentation of the theory of unidimensional unfolding as first articulated by Clyde H. Coombs (1950, 1964). The concept of the single peaked preference function (Coombs and Avrunin, 1977) which underpins unfolding theory is then presented. The article then progresses to the class of Rasch (1960) based IRT models developed by Andrich (1995) and Luo (2001). It was shown these models propose arguments not inconsistent with Coombs's (1964) original theory. The presumption of additive structure in psychological attributes was concluded to be the key weakness of the theories of unidimensional unfolding discussed.},

We hypothesized that the "acceptance" facet of mindfulness, but not the "presence" facet, is negatively associated with the magnitude of emotional behavior in four tests, i.e., (1) rating of words, (2) rating of aversive and neutral pictures, and (3) evaluative conditioning (EC). Additionally, we hypothesized that (4) the acceptance facet is associated with increased reaction time (RT) in an emotional Stroop test, and that the presence facet is associated with decreased RT and lower error rate. The sample consisted of N=247 non-clinical adults and was tested in a cross-sectional study. The results provide partial evidence that the acceptance facet of mindfulness may be associated with less aversive reactions towards aversive stimuli. Future studies should substantiate these findings but also determine their clinical relevance.},

abstract = {Measures of psychological attributes abound in the social sciences as much as measures of physical properties do in the physical sciences. However, there are crucial differences between the scientific underpinning of measurement. While measurement in the physical sciences is supported by empirical evidence that demonstrates the quantitative nature of the property assessed, measurement in the social sciences is, in large part, made possible only by a vague, discretionary definition of measurement that places hardly any restrictions on empirical data. Traditional psychometric analyses fail to address the requirements of measurement as defined more rigorously in the physical sciences. The construct definitions do not allow for testable predictions; and content validity becomes a matter of highly subjective judgment. In order to improve measurement of psychological attributes, it is suggested to, first, readopt the definition of measurement in the physical sciences; second, to devise an elaborate theory of the construct to be measured that includes the hypothesis of a quantitative attribute; and third, to test the data for the structure implied by the hypothesis of quantity as well as predictions derived from the theory of the construct.},

It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median. We discuss ways to correct ideas about mean, median, and skew, while enhancing the desired intuition.},

abstract = {Active learning is based on self-directed and autonomous teaching methods, whereas passive learning is grounded in instructor taught lectures. An animal physiology course was studied over a two-year period (Year 1, n = 42 students; Year 2, n = 30 students) to determine the effects of student-led seminar (andragogical) and lecture (pedagogical) teaching methods on students' retention of information and performance. For each year of the study, the course was divided into two time periods. The first half was dedicated to instructor-led lectures, followed by a control survey in which the students rated the efficiency of pedagogical learning on a five-point Likert scale from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree). During the second period, students engaged in andragogical learning via peer-led seminars. An experimental survey was then administered to students using the same scale as above to determine students' preferred teaching method. Raw examination scores and survey results from both halves of the course were statistically analyzed by ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. By the end of the study, student preference for peer-led seminars increased [mean +/- SD: (2.47 +/- 0.94)/(4.03 +/- 1.36), P < 0.04], and examination scores significantly increased [mean +/- SD: (73.91% +/- 13.18)/(85.77 +/- 5.22), P < 0.001]. A majority of students (68.8%) preferred a method that contained peer-led seminars and instructor-led lectures. These results may indicate that integration of active and passive learning into undergraduate courses may have greater benefit in terms of student preference and performance than either method alone.},

A statistician often is facing with this problem: he has some observations of a quantitative character x1, x2, xn and he wishes to test if those observations, being a sample of an unknown population, belong from a population with a pdf (probability density function) f(x,$\theta$), where $\theta$ is a vector of parameters to estimate with available data.

This paper aims to face fitting distributions dealing shortly with theoretical issues and practical ones using the statistical environment and language R1. R is a language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics flexible and powerful.

abstract = {Several investigators have observed that irregular breathing occurs during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in healthy subjects, with ventilatory suppression being prominent during active eye movements [phasic REM (PREM) sleep] as opposed to tonic REM (TREM) sleep, when ocular activity is absent and ventilation more regular. Inasmuch as considerable data suggest that rapid eye movements are a manifestation of sleep-induced neural events that may importantly influence respiratory neurons, we hypothesized that upper airway dilator muscle activation may also be suppressed during periods of active eye movements in REM sleep. We studied six normal men during single nocturnal sleep studies. Standard sleep-staging parameters, ventilation, and genioglossus and alae nasi electromyograms (EMG) were continuously recorded during the study. There were no significant differences in minute ventilation, tidal volume, or any index of genioglossus or alae nasi EMG amplitude between non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep, when REM was analyzed as a single sleep stage. Each breath during REM sleep was scored as "phasic" or "tonic," depending on its proximity to REM deflections on the electrooculogram. Comparison of all three sleep states (NREM, PREM, and TREM) revealed that peak inspiratory genioglossus and alae nasi EMG activities were significantly decreased during PREM sleep compared with TREM sleep [genioglossus (arbitrary units): NREM 49 +/- 12 (mean +/- SE), TREM 49 +/- 5, PREM 20 +/- 5 (P less than 0.05, PREM different from TREM and NREM); alae nasi: NREM 16 +/- 4, TREM 38 +/- 7, PREM 10 +/- 4 (P less than 0.05, PREM different from TREM)]. We also observed, as have others, that ventilation, tidal volume, and mean inspiratory airflow were significantly decreased and respiratory frequency was increased during PREM sleep compared with both TREM and NREM sleep. We conclude that hypoventilation occurs in concert with reduced upper airway dilator muscle activation during PREM sleep by mechanisms that remain to be established.},

abstract = {Objective To describe the systematic language translation and cross-cultural
evaluation process that assessed the relevance of the Hospital Consumer
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey in five European
countries prior to national data collection efforts.Design An approach
involving a systematic translation process, expert review by experienced
researchers and a review by ‘patient' experts involving the use
of content validity indexing techniques with chance correction.Setting
Five European countries where Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
Italian and Polish are spoken.Participants ‘Patient' experts
who had recently experienced a hospitalization in the participating
country.Main OutcomeMeasure(s) Content validity indexing with chance
correction adjustment providing a quantifiable measure that evaluates
the conceptual, contextual, content, semantic and technical equivalence
of the instrument in relationship to the patient care experience.Results
All translations except two received ‘excellent' ratings and
no significant differences existed between scores for languages spoken
in more than one country. Patient raters across all countries expressed
different concerns about some of the demographic questions and their
relevance for evaluating patient satisfaction. Removing demographic
questions from the evaluation produced a significant improvement
in the scale-level scores (P= .018). The cross-cultural evaluation
process suggested that translations and content of the patient satisfaction
survey were relevant across countries and languages.Conclusions The
Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
survey is relevant to some European hospital systems and has the
potential to produce internationally comparable patient satisfaction
scores.},

This structure was validated for a sample of undergraduate students using confirmatory factor analysis. Additional validity evidence was obtained through the correlation of the SATS with Wise's Attitudes Toward Statistics scale, which showed significant, positive relationships between the two instruments.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability and validity of the Southampton mindfulness questionnaire (SMQ), a 16-item measure of mindful awareness of distressing thoughts and images.

METHODS: A total of 256 people participated, comprising a non-clinical community sample of 134 (83 meditators and 51 non-meditators) and a clinical sample of 122 people with a current distressing psychosis. To assess concurrent validity, non-clinical participants and half clinical participants (total 197 participants) completed the mindful attention awareness scale (MAAS). Predicted links were assessed with affect, and 59 patients completed a validated measure to assess link between mindfulness and intensity of 'delusional' experience.

RESULTS: The scale has a single factor structure, was internally reliable, significantly correlated with the MAAS, showed expected associations with affect, and distinguished among meditators, non-meditators and people with psychosis.

CONCLUSIONS: The data support use of the SMQ in clinical practice and research to assess mindful responding to distressing thoughts and images.},

@article{Hardiker2002,
abstract = {<p><br/>In response to the need to support diverse and complex information
requirements, nursing has developed a number of different terminology
systems. The two main kinds of systems that have emerged are enumerative
systems and combinatorial systems, although some systems have characteristics
of both approaches. Differences in the structure and content of terminology
systems, while useful at a local level, prevent effective wider communication,
information sharing, integration of record systems, and comparison
of nursing elements of healthcare information at a more global level.
Formal nursing terminology systems present an alternative approach.
This paper describes a number of recent initiatives and explains
how these emerging approaches may help to augment existing nursing
terminology systems and overcome their limitations through mediation.
The development of formal nursing terminology systems is not an end
in itself and there remains a great deal of work to be done before
success can be claimed. This paper presents an overview of the key
issues outstanding and provides recommendations for a way forward.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Can behavior be unconsciously primed via the activation of attitudes, stereotypes, or other concepts? A number of studies have suggested that such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts such as <italic>professor</italic> or <italic>soccer hooligan</italic>. In 9 experiments with 475 participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its generalization and unconscious (subliminal) influences, if they occur at all, are extremely short-lived. We encourage others to explore the circumstances in which this phenomenon might be obtained.</p>},

Data were provided by 267 men and 201 women ages 19 to 93. Consistent with earlier research and evaluations, there was no support for the view that the MBTI measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types; instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions. The interpretation of the Judging-Perceiving index was also called into question. The data suggest that Jung's theory is either incorrect or inadequately operationalized by the MBTI and cannot provide a sound basis for interpreting it. However, correlational analyses showed that the four MBTI indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting MBTI findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework.},

abstract = {This study examined whether the individual capacity for self-control (as a psychological resource) moderates (i.e., buffers) the adverse influences of self-control demands (as a psychological work stressor) on employees' perceived job strain and well-being. To our knowledge this relationship has not previously been studied. In line with the match principle proposed by de Jonge and Dormann (2006), it was assumed that this moderator effect was most likely to emerge in psychological outcomes, whereas physical outcomes were expected to reflect no equivalent relationships. Data collected from 249 health care workers employed in an area of Eastern Germany confirmed both hypotheses. Psychological outcomes (such as emotional exhaustion, depressive symptoms and sleep disorders) clearly indicated that the detrimental impacts of self-control demands are attenuated with an increase in self-control capacity. By way of contrast, musculoskeletal complaints as a physical outcome, which was mainly included as a control variable, failed to reflect any effects of both predictors. Our findings draw attention to the importance of improving the match between self-control demands and self-control capacity of service employees in order to make self-control demands less stressful.},

METHODS: Selective review of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases (2003-2008) using the terms "mindfulness", "meditation", "mental health", "physical health", "quality of life", and "stress reduction." A total of 52 exemplars of empirical and theoretical work were selected for review. RESULTS: Both basic and clinical research indicate that cultivating a more mindful way of being is associated with less emotional distress, more positive states of mind, and better quality of life. In addition, mindfulness practice can influence the brain, the autonomic nervous system, stress hormones, the immune system, and health behaviors, including eating, sleeping and substance use, in salutary ways. CONCLUSION: The application of cutting-edge technology toward understanding mindfulness - an "inner technology" - is elucidating new ways in which attention, awareness, acceptance, and compassion may promote optimal health - in mind, body, relationships, and spirit.},

Studies of spatial attention have provided clear evidence that observers can bias visual processing towards specific locations, enabling faster and better processing of information at those locations than at unattended locations. We present evidence supporting the view that this process of visual selection is a key component of rehearsal in spatial working memory. Thus, although working memory has sometimes been depicted as a storage system that emerges 'downstream' of early sensory processing, current evidence suggests that spatial rehearsal recruits top-down processes that modulate the earliest stages of visual analysis.},

abstract = {The unprecedented popularity of the social networking site Facebook raises a number of important questions regarding the impact it has on sociality. However, as Facebook is a very recent social phenomenon, there is a distinct lack of psychological theory relating to its use. While research has begun to identify the types of people who use Facebook, this line of investigation has been limited to student populations. The current study aimed to investigate how personality influences usage or non-usage of Facebook. The sample consisted of 1324 self-selected Australian Internet users (1158 Facebook users and 166 Facebook nonusers), between the ages of 18 and 44. Participants were required to complete an online questionnaire package comprising the Big Five Inventory (BFI), the Narcissistic Personality Inventory - 29-item version (NPI-29), the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale (RCBS), and the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults - Short version (SELSA-S). Facebook users also completed a Facebook usage questionnaire. The results showed that Facebook users tend to be more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious and socially lonely, than nonusers. Furthermore, frequency of Facebook use and preferences for specific features were also shown to vary as a result of certain characteristics, such as neuroticism, loneliness, shyness and narcissism. It is hoped that research in this area continues, and leads to the development of theory regarding the implications and gratifications of Facebook use. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {<p><br/>The relationship between persistent pain and self-directed,
non-reactive awareness of present-moment experience (i.e., mindfulness)
was explored in one of the dominant psychological theories of chronic
pain - the fear-avoidance model [53]. A heterogeneous sample of 104
chronic pain outpatients at a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Australia
completed psychometrically sound self-report measures of major variables
in this model: Pain intensity, negative affect, pain catastrophizing,
pain-related fear, pain hypervigilance, and functional disability.
Two measures of mindfulness were also used, the Mindful Attention
Awareness Scale [4] and the Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire
[1]. Results showed that mindfulness significantly negatively predicts
each of these variables, accounting for 17-41% of their variance.
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that mindfulness
uniquely predicts pain catastrophizing when other variables are controlled,
and moderates the relationship between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing.
This is the first clear evidence substantiating the strong link between
mindfulness and pain catastrophizing, and suggests mindfulness might
be added to the fear-avoidance model. Implications for the clinical
use of mindfulness in screening and intervention are discussed.</p>},

Groups responded similarly to nonmasked pictures. In the masked condition, only controls showed discrimination in valence self-reports. However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination in the masked condition.

its suitability for assessing depression among this group. METHOD
Three hundred and fifteen in-patients undergoing post-acute specialist
in-patient rehabilitation at the Regional Rehabilitation Unit (RRU)
of Northwick Park Hospital in North London were administered the
Beck Depression Inventory. All patients were administered the BDI-II
by a clinical psychologist using a large print version and taking
as much time as patients required. Rasch analysis was completed using
the RUMM2020 software. Where disordered thresholds were identified
item rescoring was undertaken. Each item was also examined for Differential
Item Functioning. Where misfit to model expectations was identified
items were removed in an iterative fashion. The effect of any deletion
upon person estimates was examined. Specific tests of unidimensionality
were undertaken at each iterative phase. RESULTS Rescoring was necessary
before Items 1-4, 6, 8-12, 20 and 21 showed ordered thresholds. Three
items failed to satisfy model expectations - items 16 (changes in
sleeping pattern), 18 (changes in appetite) and 21 (loss of interest
in sex) and were deleted - after which good overall fit to the Rasch
model was observed. The three items deleted affected person estimates
in a significant way such that the 21 item version in this group
of patients may be biased because of multidimensionality. CONCLUSIONS
The BDI-II in a sample of patients undergoing neurorehabilitation
satisfies unidimensional Rasch model expectations in an 18-item format.
Some disordering of response categories was evident, but this evidence
requires replication before any common rescoring option should be
considered.},

abstract = {In their articles in this special section of the Journal of Personality, the authors have focused their attention on the role of individual differences in self-monitoring for a variety of interpersonal phenomena. In so doing, the authors have provided an overview of the theoretical and empirical contributions of the psychology of self-monitoring to the domains of interest: close relationships, consumer behavior, behavior in the workplace, and social interaction. As each of the contributing authors to this special section suggests, much more theoretical and empirical work is in order if the impact of individual differences in self-monitoring for the phenomena reviewed here is to be fully appreciated. Moreover, the four domains of interest represented in this special section by no means exhaust the areas to which theorists and researchers have applied or can apply the psychology of individual differences in self-monitoring. Given the large nomological network that currently exists involving the self-monitoring construct, it is anticipated that the breadth and depth of applications of the psychology of self-monitoring will only continue to expand as it has in the last 30 years since the appearance of the construct in the literature.},

The study design and consequent study type are major determinants of a study's scientific quality and clinical value. METHODS: This article describes the structured classification of studies into two types, primary and secondary, as well as a further subclassification of studies of primary type. This is done on the basis of a selective literature search concerning study types in medical research, in addition to the authors' own experience. RESULTS: Three main areas of medical research can be distinguished by study type: basic (experimental), clinical, and epidemiological research. Furthermore, clinical and epidemiological studies can be further subclassified as either interventional or noninterventional. CONCLUSIONS: The study type that can best answer the particular research question at hand must be determined not only on a purely scientific basis, but also in view of the available financial resources, staffing, and practical feasibility (organization, medical prerequisites, number of patients, etc.).},

abstract = {Impulsivity is generally held to be an important dimension of personality. It has been conceptualized in many different ways: as a cognitive style termed impulsivity/reflection, as a subtrait of extraversion or psychoticism, and as a trait of its own. The present study focused on the relation between some of these different impulsivity aspects and response latencies to questionnaires. The Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), a self-report impulsivity questionnaire, and the Self-Consciousness Scale (SCS) were administered to 65 Austrian undergraduate students. By means of a computerized presentation, questionnaire response latencies were recorded. Virtually no relationship was found between MFFT, self-report impulsivity, and response latencies. In addition to previous studies, the present results, therefore, cast doubt on a broad impulsivity concept. Secondary findings of this study are pertinent to the relation between impulsivity and anxiety, to the orthogonality of impulsivity and self-consciousness, and to sex differences in impulsivity.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

A consensus is emerging that there is a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding a range of selected topics in nursing education. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the available literature in order to synthesize the effects of PBL in nursing education. Using a number of databases, we identified studies related to the effectiveness of PBL in nursing. An analysis was conducted on a range of outcome variables, including overall effect sizes and effects of evidence and evaluation levels, learning environment, and study characteristics. We found that the effect of PBL in nursing education is 0.70 standard deviations (medium-to-large effect size). We also found that PBL has positive effects on the outcome domains of satisfaction with training, clinical education, and skill course. These results may act as a guide for nurse educators with regard to the conditions under which PBL is more effective than traditional learning strategies.},

abstract = {The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the popular and powerful techniques for decision making. A detailed survey of the literature has revealed that there exists no formal evaluation of the group preference aggregation methods currently employed in AHP. This paper provides such an evaluation using well established social choice axioms, which govern the process of combining individual opinions to obtain a single group opinion. The Geometric Mean Method (GMM) and the Weighted Arithmetic Mean Method (WAMM) are the two methods evaluated. It is shown, using counter-examples, that the GMM does not always satisfy the Pareto optimality axiom, which is one of the prominent and widely accepted social choice axioms. This finding is significant as the GMM has been the most commonly used method in AHP for combining individual opinions to form a group opinion. The other method, viz. WAMM has satisfied all the axioms, except the ‘independence of irrelevant alternatives' axiom. In order to use the WAMM, one has to find the weightages (importance) to be assigned to the members of the group. This is often a difficult task, especially so if the group is large as in the case of public policy decisions and when judgements are elicited through the use of questionnaires. These situations need an objective method to derive members' weightages but only a few studies are available in the literature to address such a situation. We propose a simple and intuitively appealing eigenvector based method to intrinsically determine the weightages for group members using their own subjective opinions. The superiority of the proposed method over the previous methods is brought out in the paper.},

abstract = {The striking diversity of psychological and neurophysiological models of 'time perception' characterizes the debate on how and where in the brain time is processed. In this review, the most prominent models of time perception will be critically discussed. Some of the variation across the proposed models will be explained, namely (i) different processes and regions of the brain are involved depending on the length of the processed time interval, and (ii) different cognitive processes may be involved that are not necessarily part of a core timekeeping system but, nevertheless, influence the experience of time. These cognitive processes are distributed over the brain and are difficult to discern from timing mechanisms. Recent developments in the research on emotional influences on time perception, which succeed decades of studies on the cognition of temporal processing, will be highlighted. Empirical findings on the relationship between affect and time, together with recent conceptualizations of self- and body processes, are integrated by viewing time perception as entailing emotional and interoceptive (within the body) states. To date, specific neurophysiological mechanisms that would account for the representation of human time have not been identified. It will be argued that neural processes in the insular cortex that are related to body signals and feeling states might constitute such a neurophysiological mechanism for the encoding of duration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Valid instruments to measure practitioners' attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines need to be developed. However, few of the available instruments have been thoroughly validated.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To adapt into French and to test the reliability and validity of a scale for measurement of attitudes towards guidelines developed by Elovainio et al.\n\nMETHODS: A 27-item scale (divided into six dimensions) measuring attitudes towards guidelines was translated into French by two English native translators, reviewed and finalized by expert committee and administered to 314 practitioners who agreed to participate. Main practitioners' characteristics were collected. Item and dimension reproducibility were assessed for 62 practitioners by calculation of intraclass correlation coefficients. Internal construct validity was assessed by principal components analyses. Convergent and discriminant validity were analysed.\n\nRESULTS: Item response rates ranged from 82 to 100%. In the test-retest procedure, intraclass correlation coefficients for separate items ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 and those for dimensions were 0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-0.8] for usefulness, 0.5 (0.3-0.6) for reliability, 0.4 (0.2-0.5) for individual competence, 0.5 (0.3-0.6) for organizational competence, 0.7 (0.5-0.8) for impracticality and 0.4 (0.3-0.6) for availability. The factorial structure after Varimax rotation showed that none of the different solutions obtained had a strictly comparable structure to that of the original scale. External construct validity was satisfactory.\n\nCONCLUSION: This scale does not have satisfactory psychometric properties and therefore cannot confidently be used in future research assessing whether attitudes towards guidelines are a determining factor in physicians' compliance with guidelines. More research is needed to develop valid scales in a more rigorous procedure, involving qualitative and quantitative steps.},

Even without other incentives to be creative, romantic motives enhanced creativity on subjective and objective measures. For men, any cue designed to activate a short-term or a long-term mating goal increased creative displays; however, women displayed more creativity only when primed to attract a high-quality long-term mate. These creative boosts were unrelated to increased effort on creative tasks or to changes in mood or arousal. Furthermore, results were unaffected by the application of monetary incentives for creativity. These findings align with the view that creative displays in both sexes may be linked to sexual selection, qualified by unique exigencies of human parental investment.},

Autonomic activity (heart rate and skin conductance) was concurrently
measured to determine whether pupillary changes are mediated by parasympathetic

changes were larger when viewing emotionally arousing pictures, regardless
of whether these were pleasant or unpleasant. Pupillary changes during
picture viewing covaried with skin conductance change, supporting
the interpretation that sympathetic nervous system activity modulates
these changes in the context of affective picture viewing. Taken

the pupil's response during affective picture viewing reflects emotional
arousal associated with increased sympathetic activity.},

In light of these puzzling results, I propose that the relationship between extraversion and sales performance is not linear but curvilinear: Ambiverts achieve greater sales productivity than extraverts or introverts do. Because they naturally engage in a flexible pattern of talking and listening, ambiverts are likely to express sufficient assertiveness and enthusiasm to persuade and close a sale but are more inclined to listen to customers' interests and less vulnerable to appearing too excited or overconfident. A study of 340 outbound-call-center representatives supported the predicted inverted-U-shaped relationship between extraversion and sales revenue. This research presents a fresh perspective on the personality traits that facilitate successful influence and offers novel insights for people in choosing jobs and for organizations in hiring and training employees.},

In the context of Psychoinformatics, we emphasize the cooperation between the disciplines of psychology and computer science in handling large data sets derived from heavily used devices, such as smartphones or online social network sites, in order to shed light on a large number of psychological traits, including personality and mood. New challenges await psychologists in light of the resulting "Big Data" sets, because classic psychological methods will only in part be able to analyze this data derived from ubiquitous mobile devices, as well as other everyday technologies. As a consequence, psychologists must enrich their scientific methods through the inclusion of methods from informatics. The paper provides a brief review of one area of this research field, dealing mainly with social networks and smartphones. Moreover, we highlight how data derived from Psychoinformatics can be combined in a meaningful way with data from human neuroscience. We close the paper with some observations of areas for future research and problems that require consideration within this new discipline.},

abstract = {NHS braced for worst of Alistair Darling's {\pounds}5bn spending cuts Published: 27 November 2008 09:00 Author: Sally Gainsbury More by this Author Last Updated: 27 November 2008 10:01 Reader Responses The Treasury believes there are savings to be made with the NHS budget The Treasury believes there are savings to be made with the NHS budget Increase image View all images The NHS must prepare for a substantial cut in planned funding from the year after next. Chancellor Alistair Darling's pre-Budget report set out plans to cut {\pounds}5bn from government spending plans for 2010-11 - and the NHS is the largest of 12 areas that could be hit. In the past, some efficiency savings have been delivered through productivity gains - doing more for the same money - rather than through resources being cut. But the Treasury describes the {\pounds}5bn as "recoverable savings" and removes any doubt as to whether these will involve cuts to funding allocations by clearly subtracting {\pounds}5bn from its latest table of departmental revenue allocations for 2010-11. "I suspect people will have their allocations reduced and told that now they are 'world class' they will have to get on with it" The {\pounds}70bn NHS commissioning budget is cited as an area in which the Treasury believes savings could be made. It explicitly links efficiency savings with the world class commissioning programme, which the Department of Health has previously stressed is all about quality improvement. It says: "As primary care trusts enhance their commissioning skills towards world class standards over the next years they will unlock cashable value-for-money improvements across the {\pounds}70bn of commissioned health services." Value for money The precise "value for money impact" of the world class commissioning programme will be set out in the Budget next year, as will the "scope to increase efficiency further" through the hospital tariff. Alan Downey, head of healthcare at consultants KPMG, said: "This is new. The focus up to now has been on the 11 world class commissioning competencies... There has been no focus on cost savings as the aim of the exercise." NHS Confederation policy director Nigel Edwards said: "I suspect people will have their allocations reduced and told that now they are 'world class' they will have to get on with it." But DH director general of commissioning and system management Mark Britnell told HSJ: "This is a great opportunity for world class commissioning to demonstrate that PCTs can make sound financial investments and meet government efficiency targets." The report says the Treasury's public value programme has identified {\pounds}100m a year that could be saved from 2010-11 by improving use of the NHS estate to "reduce the need for new hospital space". It also paves the way for entire PCT property estates to be transferred to public-private partnerships, to be known as PropCos. The 2009-10 operating framework will contain more details of the plans. Budget cuts The details of the cuts to each of the 12 government spending areas will be set out in the Budget. The approximate total value of government spending that will be prime targets for cuts is {\pounds}250bn, of which {\pounds}5bn is 2 per cent. A 2 per cent cut to the NHS budget would be {\pounds}2.1bn. If the savings were shared between government departments according to the same proportion as previous year's efficiency targets, the DH's cut would be nearer {\pounds}1.35bn. Mr Edwards said there was a danger that the NHS's share of the {\pounds}5bn cut would be passed on to acute providers through reductions in tariff prices and contracts. "That would not be efficiency," he said, adding that PCTs must "urgently" look to make savings by using cheaper procedures and treatments. An extra {\pounds}100m in capital funds will be spent upgrading up to 600 GP practices to "training practices" as part of Mr Darling's {\pounds}3bn attempt to stimulate the economy by bringing forward planned investment. Last year's comprehensive spending review pledged to increase public sector spending in real terms by an average of 1.9 per cent a year between 2008-09 and 2010-11. But the pre-Budget report says spending will grow by just 1.2 per cent in real terms between 2011-12 and 2013-14. A DH spokesman said the NHS was well placed for the challenges ahead. "The NHS has a good track record," he said. THE REPORT IN NUMBERS {\pounds}5bn The total reduction to planned public spending in 2010-11. {\pounds}1.35bn- {\pounds}2.5bn The NHS's likely share of the reduction. {\pounds}32.7bn Total value of the non-hospital trust NHS estate, part of which could be transferred to public- private partnerships. {\pounds}100m Savings the Treasury expects the NHS to make per year by cutting hospital space. KEY POINTS NHS budget one of 12 areas of public spending highlighted as a target for a share of {\pounds}5bn of cuts to planned spending in 2010-11 Commissioning cited as area in which savings could be made and world class commissioning will be assessed in next year's Budget for the impact it will have on value for money LIFT scheme to be expanded, with DH due to announce plans for PCTs to transfer entire estates to public private partnership schemes {\pounds}100m of planned capital spending brought forward from 2010-11 to 2009-10 to upgrade 600 GP practices into training practices as part of the Treasury's {\pounds}3bn "fiscal stimulus" {\pounds}1.1bn net cut from planned capital spending between 2009 and 2011. DH says this is due to an earlier overestimate of the cost of stockpiling pandemic flu vaccine},

abstract = {This paper examines whether a subject's decisions in the ultimatum game played for multiple periods using the strategy method are affected by his or her partner's gender. We find that although there are some initial gender influences on behavior, these do not persist as subject behavior is systematically different in the first period than it is in later periods. In particular, subjects are significantly more likely to offer an even division of the pie in the first period, clustering on a focal distribution before exploring other offers. The differences between our results and the extant results in the literature underscore a need for careful replication of results dealing with gender differences. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The mediation question focuses on the intervening mechanism that produces the treatment effect. The moderation question focuses on factors that affect the magnitude of the treatment effect. It is important to note that these two processes may be combined in informative ways, such that moderation is mediated or mediation is moderated. Although some prior literature has discussed these possibilities, their exact definitions and analytic procedures have not been completely articulated. The purpose of this article is to define precisely both mediated moderation and moderated mediation and provide analytic strategies for assessing each.},

@article{Kaplan1998,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To summarize the development and application of a generic measure of health-related quality of life known as the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB). BACKGROUND: The QWB is part of a general health policy model. The measure includes functional components for mobility, physical activity, and social activity. In addition, it includes a comprehensive list of symptoms and problems. QWB scoring allows placement of each individual on a continuum of wellness ranging from 0 (for dead) to 1.0 for asymptomatic full function. The General Health Policy Model combines this point in time measure with information on prognosis and mortality to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Forming a ratio of program costs to QALYs yields estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year. Evidence supports the validity of the QWB for a wide variety of applications in population monitoring, descriptive studies of patient populations, and clinical trials. We offer a variety of comparisons between the QWB and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). MAIN FINDINGS: In comparison with the SF-36, the QWB provides less information on health profiles, but has the advantage of providing a metric that can be used for cost-utility or cost-effectiveness analysis. Although ceiling effects are common for some SF-36 subscales, perfect scores on the QWB are very rare. The QWB has an approximately normal distribution for populations of adults. Although, often criticized for not including a mental health component, we present evidence documenting the validity of the QWB for patients with psychological and psychiatric diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The QWB and SF-36 are alternative comprehensive measures of health outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the role of the health care professional in creating an optimal healing environment (OHE), with a special focus on which inner state and way of being in the world can create a healing intention. A core thesis is that every healing effort and every healing intention starts within the health care professional. An accepting, mindful, and warm-hearted relationship with self is primary to any healing intention. Important concepts to develop such an attitude are mindfulness, love, compassion, and awareness. The concept of a healing attitude toward the self is described, as is the mirror principle that states there is symmetry between someone's relationship with the outer world and his or her inner world. The mindfulness concept is outlined through a set of mental and heart qualities. Mindfulness is strongly related to compassion, and it is compassion that serves as a source for all healing intentionality. Compassion connects the suffering of the patient with the healer's own suffering, and this emotional connection instantiates a healing relationship. The power and importance of mindfulness and compassion for healing are explored along the Frank model of nonspecific therapeutic components. This is the approach whereby a health care professional can elicit self-healing powers in patients through his or her inner attitudes. Finally, a research program and some hypotheses on how to implement and research this specific approach toward the creation of an OHE are outlined.},

abstract = {The high incidence and the severe symptoms of cancer have a considerable
effect on quality of life in patients. The relationship between quality
of life in patients with cancer and treatment, early diagnosis, disease
acceptance, pain, psychological distress, loss of organ, duration
of disease, and caregivers was investigated. This study included
508 patients with cancer treated in either inpatient or outpatient
clinics of 5 oncology centers in Ankara, Turkey, between August 1998
and January 2000. Patients were selected by interviews. Data were
collected by a questionnaire to determine disease features and to
evaluate patients' quality of life. We found that several disease
features, including treatment, early diagnosis, disease acceptance,
pain, psychological distress, and caregivers, had an effect on patients'
quality of life (P < 0.05), whereas loss of organ and duration of
disease did not. The results of this study underline the significant
effect of psychosocial care programs on quality of life. In the future,
assessments of quality of life can help healthcare personnel to prepare
psychosocial care programs. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,

abstract = {Current notions of social exclusion are to an extent anchored in older concerns with relative poverty, which had the merit of considering not just material deprivation but also the social and cultural dimensions of participation or exclusion. The focus of this article is on the role of ICTs in relation to people's ability to participate in society. It draws upon detailed qualitative research on single parent and young elderly households to explore what counts as experiences of inclusion or exclusion and the processes behind them. Dealing mainly, but not exclusively, with the more traditional ICTs of telephony and broadcasting, the article considers processes of self-exclusion as people have mixed evaluations of these technologies derived both from current circumstances and past experiences. It then looks beyond the acquisition of ICTs to show how other modes of access to these resources are important before reflecting upon the quality of experience of ICTs, not just in terms of the functionality on offer but also taking into account that technologies are themselves symbolic goods. Finally, and drawing on more recent research, the article asks what lessons might be learnt from these traditional ICTs when considering newly emerging ones like the internet. },

abstract = {In this book, Sanjoy Mahajan shows us that the way to master complexity is through insight rather than precision. Precision can overwhelm us with information, whereas insight connects seemingly disparate pieces of information into a simple picture. Unlike computers, humans depend on insight. Based on the author's fifteen years of teaching at MIT, Cambridge University, and Olin College, The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering shows us how to build insight and find understanding, giving readers tools to help them solve any problem in science and engineering. To master complexity, we can organize it or discard it. The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering first teaches the tools for organizing complexity, then distinguishes the two paths for discarding complexity: with and without loss of information. Questions and problems throughout the text help readers master and apply these groups of tools. Armed with this three-part toolchest, and without complicated mathematics, readers can estimate the flight range of birds and planes and the strength of chemical bonds, understand the physics of pianos and xylophones, and explain why skies are blue and sunsets are red.

validation of the French version of the FFMQ.Method Two hundred and
fourteen participants were tested using the French version of the

the French version of the FFMQ has good psychometric properties and
a structural validity similar to the initial version.Conclusion This
adaptation constituted a validated mindfulness measure for French-speaking

abstract = {Therapeutic interventions that incorporate training in mindfulness
meditation have become increasingly popular, but to date little is
known about neural mechanisms associated with these interventions.
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely
used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce
positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms
of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal
study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration
attributable to participation in an MBSR program. Anatomical magnetic
resonance (MR) images from 16 healthy, meditation-na{\"{i}}ve participants
were obtained before and after they underwent the 8-week program.
Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based
morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17
individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases
in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain
analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex,
the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group
compared with the controls. The results suggest that participation
in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in
brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion
regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.},

Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Findings: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

One profitable but overlooked solution may be for restaurants to focus on menu engineering strategies that could increase sales of relatively healthier, high margin appetizers and entr{\'{e}}es and help diners become slim by design. Recent lab and field research in consumer psychology and behavioral economics offer promising solutions that responsible restaurants can use to profitably guide their customers to healthier decisions by using the three-step menu engineering process of (1) shifting attention, (2) enhancing taste expectations, and (3) increasing perception of value. A review of these studies provides key implications that can both increase the healthfulness of what customers order along with the profits of the restaurant.},

abstract = {The question of how organizations change is essential both for intra-organizational change agents and external stakeholders. Many non-governmental organizations are asking how they can evaluate their influence, but their understanding of organizational change may actually inhibit change. This article touches on inadequacies in current theorizing - related to conceptualizations of communication and learning - which, it is argued, adversely affect attempts to bring about change. It then outlines the process of evaluating organizational influence using an innovative, second-order' approach that was pioneered in the context of evaluating the work of an organization advocating sustainable development with sector-leading companies. In order to create an evaluation yardstick', an heuristic model was constructed to represent organizational learning for sustainable development' (OLSD). The model posited that patterns of organization and networks exist, evolve and are challenged via persistent conversational lineages' - sets of discernible inherited and recurring distinctions - that weave through dynamic conversations over time. By defining the constituent distinctions of a particular conversational lineage and then bounding qualitative data into narrative accounts, it was possible to trace accurately the organizational levels in the narrative accounts through which a conversational lineage ran. It was then possible to evaluate associated possibilities and constraints to OLSD. This led both to conclusions about the extent of the advocacy organization's influence and to relative measures of progress in OLSD. Both the model of OLSD and evaluation approach, it is suggested, are potentially applicable in other organizational, network and subject domains, other than that of sustainable development.},

Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70% versus 12%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The age-related deterioration of physiological capacities
such as muscle strength and balance is associated with increased
dependence. Understanding the contribution of physical fitness components
to functional performance facilitates the development of adequate
exercise interventions aiming at preservation of function and independence
of older people. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship
between physical fitness components and functional performance in
older people living in long-term care facilities. METHODS: Design
cross-sectional study. Subjects 226 persons living in long-term care
facilities (mean age: 81.6 +/- 5.6). Outcome measures Physical fitness
and functional performance were measured by performance-based tests.
RESULTS: Knee and elbow extension strength were significantly higher
in men (difference = 44.5 and 50.0 N, respectively), whereas women
were more flexible (difference sit & reach test = 7.2 cm). Functional
performance was not significantly different between the genders.
In men, motor coordination (eye-hand coordination) and measures of
strength were the main contributors to functional performance, whereas
in women flexibility (sit and reach test) and motor coordination
(tandem stance and eye-hand coordination) played a major role. CONCLUSION:
The results of this study show that besides muscle strength, fitness
components such as coordination and flexibility are associated with
functional performance of older people living in long-term care facilities.
This suggests that men and women living in long-term care facilities,
differ considerably concerning the fitness factors contributing to
functional performance. Women and men may, therefore, need exercise
programs emphasizing different fitness aspects in order to improve
functional performance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors contributing most to variability in patient experience in order to present approaches for fairer benchmarking of hospitals and for quality improvement. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a widely used survey on patient experience. SETTING: Inpatients from all 24 acute hospitals in the Canton of Bern in Switzerland. Data collection followed the standardized and validated Picker Institute methodology for a period of 13 weeks in the fall/winter of 2005. PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients age 18 years and older (n = 14 089), discharged within the sampling period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 'Patient experience', measured by the total Picker Problem Score (PPS) and by six domain scores (care, communication, respect, cooperation, organization, discharge management). RESULTS: In regression analysis, the patient factors self-reported health, age and education explained the highest proportion of variability in the PPS (4.8, 2.2 and 0.7 per cent, respectively). Multiple linear adjustment for factors associated with patients removed between 29 and 33 per cent of variability between hospital categories. The domain score means varied from under 5 per cent for 'respect towards the patient' to 34 per cent for 'discharge management'. Ranking of hospitals by domain scores differed from the ranking based on the total PPS. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical adjustment for patient mix and additional stratification for some hospital factors make benchmarking using patient survey data fairer and more transparent. Use of our approach for presenting quality data may make interpretation easier for the different target groups and may enhance the relevance of such information for decision-making. [Abstract]},

It explains inconsistencies in probe studies of attention and fear conditioning and provides a new approach to emotional perception, imagery, and memory. Emotions are organized biphasically, as appetitive or aversive (defensive). Reflexes with the same valence as an ongoing emotional state are augmented; mismatched reflexes are inhibited. Thus, the startle response (an aversive reflex) is enhanced during a fear state and is diminished in a pleasant emotional context. This affect-startle effect is not determined by general arousal, simple attention, or probe modality. The effect is found when affects are prompted by pictures or memory images, changes appropriately with aversive conditioning, and may be dependent on right-hemisphere processing. Implications for clinical, neurophysiological, and basic research in emotion are outlined.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms. },

abstract = {Objective: Catastrophic thinking is associated with disability and
distress for many with chronic pain. The effects of catastrophic
thinking likely rely not only on the content or frequency of the
thoughts, but also on other cognitive, behavioral, and environmental
influences that are present. One possible influence is acceptance,
which involves experiencing thoughts, moods, or sensations without
some of their supplemental psychological effects on behavior, especially
when these effects can contribute to less freedom in daily functioning.
Design: The present study sought to explore how acceptance influenced
the relations between catastrophizing and patient functioning in
344 individuals with chronic pain. Main Outcome Measures: Chronic
Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Results:
Analyses indicated that acceptance mediated the effects of catastrophic
thinking on depression, anxiety and avoidance, and physical and psychosocial
functioning with indirect effect tests suggesting that the variance
in functioning predicted by catastrophizing was significantly reduced
with the inclusion of acceptance. Conclusion: These results suggest
that research and clinical work in the area may benefit from a broadened
perspective where the occurrence of catastrophic thinking is considered
within the wider context of the behavioral processes that give this
thinking its impact.},

Ambulatory systolic blood pressure, ambulatory\n         diastolic blood pressure, and ambulatory heart rate were recorded over 24-hour periods at pretest and posttest every 20 minutes\n         during self-reported normal waking hours and every 30 minutes during self-reported normal sleep hours using Spacelabs 90207\n         monitors. \n      \n         \n         RESULTS: Significant (p < .05) differences in average change from pretest to posttest were found between the meditation and health eduction control\n         groups for resting systolic blood pressure (–2.7 vs. 1.1 mm Hg), daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure after school (–2.0\n         vs. 3.6 mm Hg), daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure after school (0.1 vs. 4.3 mm Hg), and daytime ambulatory heart\n         rate after school (–5.3 vs. 0.3 bpm). \n      \n         \n         CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of meditation on blood pressure and heart rate in the\n         natural environment in healthy normotensive youth.},

abstract = {Psychologists and psychiatrists commonly rely on self-reports or interviews to diagnose or treat behavioral addictions. The present study introduces a novel source of data: recordings of the actual problem behavior under investigation. A total of N = 58 participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire measuring problematic mobile phone behavior featuring several questions on weekly phone usage. After filling in the questionnaire, all participants received an application to be installed on their smartphones, which recorded their phone usage for five weeks. The analyses revealed that weekly phone usage in hours was overestimated; in contrast, numbers of call and text message related variables were underestimated. Importantly, several associations between actual usage and being addicted to mobile phones could be derived exclusively from the recorded behavior, but not from self-report variables. The study demonstrates the potential benefit to include methods of psychoinformatics in the diagnosis and treatment of problematic mobile phone use.},

abstract = {Conspicuous displays of consumption and benevolence might serve as "costly signals" of desirable mate qualities. If so, they should vary strategically with manipulations of mating-related motives. The authors examined this possibility in 4 experiments. Inducing mating goals in men increased their willingness to spend on conspicuous luxuries but not on basic necessities. In women, mating goals boosted public--but not private--helping. Although mating motivation did not generally inspire helping in men, it did induce more helpfulness in contexts in which they could display heroism or dominance. Conversely, although mating motivation did not lead women to conspicuously consume, it did lead women to spend more publicly on helpful causes. Overall, romantic motives seem to produce highly strategic and sex-specific self-presentations best understood within a costly signaling framework.},

abstract = {One hundred tennis players were recruited from the professional men's
tennis tour to investigate the correlation between hip internal rotation
deficits and low back pain (LBP), as well as shoulder internal rotation
deficits and shoulder pain. A statistically significant correlation
was observed between dominant shoulder internal rotation deficits
and shoulder pain. Also observed was a statistically significant
correlation between lead hip internal rotation deficits and lumbar
extension deficits with LBP. We conclude that due to repetitive demands
on the dominant shoulder and repetitive pivoting at the lead hip,
the cycle of microtrauma and scar formation leads to capsular contracture
and subsequent reduction in internal range of motion. It is likely
that the limitation in lumbar extension in the symptomatic group
is not only due to decreased flexibility from an increased load on
the spine, but also due to a protective mechanism to prevent further
exacerbation of the LBP. Physical conditioning that includes shoulder
as well as hip internal rotation stretching programs should therefore
be essential aspects in the treatment of tennis players with shoulder
pain and LBP respectively.},

abstract = {Introduction: Data on endoscopic resection of sporadic duodenal adenoma (SDA) are sparse; wepresent our results concerning safety and effi− cacy in a retrospective analysis of saline−assisted endoscopic resection of SDA. Patients and methods: The cases of all patients who underwent endoscopic resection for SDA be− tween May 1998 and May 2006 were analyzed. Endoscopic resection was carried out using standard injection and cut methods. In some pa− tients hemoclips and argon plasma coagulation were used, either for prophylaxis or for the treat− ment of procedure−related bleeding. Results: Thirty−six patients with a total of 37 le− sions (mean size 19mm, range 4?50mm) were analyzed. Lesions larger than 20mm were more frequently resected piecemeal (P = 0.022). Intra− procedural bleeding occurred in 14% of cases, without any significant association with lesion size or the resection technique. One fatal perforation occurred. Macroscopically complete resec− tion was achieved in 97% of cases, as confirmed by at least one negative control endoscopy with biopsies after a mean follow−up of 15 months. Al− though clipping and argon plasma coagulation were not applied in any systematic way, it was noticeable that in the 20 cases in which they were used for hemostasis or prevention, no de− layed bleeding was observed after the proce− dures. In contrast, bleeding occurred in 22% of the 23 procedures performed without these ad− ditional techniques. Conclusion: Endoscopic resection is an efficient and acceptably safe technique for treating SDA. Further studies need to assess whether systema− tic bleeding prophylaxis will reduce the inci− dence of delayed hemorrhage after endoscopic resection.},

Participants received a scenario in which an actor becomes acquainted to a potential partner who was judged by a friend of the actor with regard to physical attractiveness (low vs. high) and dominance (low vs. high). The participants indicated whether the actor would call the potential partner (short-term perspective) and whether the actor was interested in a romantic relationship (long-term perspective). Participants assumed that male actors are mainly influenced by ratings regarding physical attractiveness. Regarding female actors, it was assumed that whereas they especially value physical attractiveness given a short-term perspective, the potential partner has to be both attractive and dominant given a long-term perspective.

abstract = {Es werden die Eigenschaften der 8 Items umfassenden Ungewi{\ss}heitstoleranzskala (UGT) beschrieben. Die Skala erwies sich als homogen und stabil, korrelierte negativ mit dem Alter, kovariierte mit dem Geschlecht (M{\"{a}}nner waren ungewi{\ss}heitstoleranter) und war unabh{\"{a}}ngig von der Tendenz zu sozial erw{\"{u}}nschtem Antwortverhalten. Personen suchten um so eher Situationen auf, in denen sie Neues erfahren konnten (Gesundheitsvorsorgekurs), oder ertrugen ungewisse Situationen (Ungewi{\ss}heit {\"{u}}ber eine m{\"{o}}gliche Schwangerschaft) um so l{\"{a}}nger, je ungewi{\ss}heitstoleranter sie waren. Mit wachsender Ungewi{\ss}heitstoleranz war die Neigung zur positiven Umdeutung einer Belastungssituation (bei Eltern von Risikokindern, bei T{\"{o}}chtern, die ihre bettl{\"{a}}gerigen M{\"{u}}tter pflegten) ausgepr{\"{a}}gter. Auch war die Depressivit{\"{a}}t akut (Frauen im Schwangerschaftskonflikt) sowie dauerhaft belasteter Frauen (M{\"{u}}tter behinderter Kinder) um so schw{\"{a}}cher, je ungewi{\ss}heitstoleranter sie waren.  The properties of the uncertainty tolerance scale are given. The scale consists of 8 items, was homogeneous and stable, correlated negatively with age, covaried with gender (men were more uncertainty tolerant), and was independent of social desirability. Persons participated with a higher probability in a situation in which they could learn something new (here: a health prevention course) or they endured longer in an uncertain situation (uncertainty about a possible pregnancy) the higher their uncertainty tolerance was. With increased uncertainty tolerance the probability of finding a positive meaning in one's burdening situation (having a disabled child, caring for a bed-ridden mother) was higher. Additionally, the psychic well-being of acute (women with a pregnancy conflict) or chronically burdened women (mothers of a disabled child) was higher the higher their uncertainty tolerance was.},

abstract = {For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and objective: There are no nursing centric data in the
hospital discharge abstract. This study investigates whether adding
nursing data in the form of nursing diagnoses to medical diagnostic
data in the discharge abstract can improve overall explanation of
variance in commonly studied hospital outcomes. Method: A retrospective
analyses of 123,241 sequential patient admissions to a university
hospital in a Midwestern city was performed. Two data sets were combined:
(1) a daily collection of patient assessments by nurses using nursing
diagnosis terminology (NDX); and (2) the summary discharge information
from the hospital discharge abstract including diagnosis-related
group (DRG) and all payer refined DRG (APR-DRG). Each of 61 daily
NDX observations were collapsed as frequency of occurrence for the
hospital stay and inserted into the discharge abstract. NDX was then
compared to both DRG and APR-DRG across 5 hospital outcome variables
using multivariate regression or logistic regression. Results and
conclusions: In all statistical models, DRG, APR-DRG, and NDX were
significantly associated with the 5 hospital outcome variables (P
<.0001). When NDX was added to models containing either the DRG or
the APR-DRG, explanatory power (R2) and model discrimination (c statistic)
improved by 30% to 146% across the outcome variables of hospital
length of stay, ICU length of stay, total charges, probably of death,
and discharge to a nursing home (P <.0001). The findings support
the contention that nursing care is an independent predictor of patient
hospital outcomes. These nursing data are not redundant with the
medical diagnosis, in particular, the DRG. The findings support the
argument for including nursing care data in the hospital discharge
abstract. Further study is needed to clarify which nursing data are
the best fit for the current hospital discharge abstract data collection
scheme. (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

Also presented are data relating to a recent clarification of RST,
viz. the joint subsystems hypothesis, which postulates a fundamental
interdependence of appetitive and aversive systems in the typical
human laboratory. The value of Gray's general approach to building
behavioural theories on the bases of both the conceptual nervous
system and the real nervous system is validated in personality, which
has long been thought a philosophical mystery rather than a standard

abstract = {Mindfulness meditators practice the non-judgmental observation of
the ongoing stream of internal experiences as they arise. Using voxel-based
morphometry, this study investigated MRI brain images of 20 mindfulness
(Vipassana) meditators (mean practice 8.6 years; 2 h daily) and compared
the regional gray matter concentration to that of non-meditators
matched for sex, age, education and handedness. Meditators were predicted
to show greater gray matter concentration in regions that are typically
activated during meditation. Results confirmed greater gray matter
concentration for meditators in the right anterior insula, which
is involved in interoceptive awareness. This group difference presumably
reflects the training of bodily awareness during mindfulness meditation.
Furthermore, meditators had greater gray matter concentration in
the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus. Both regions
have previously been found to be involved in meditation. The mean
value of gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal
gyrus was predictable by the amount of meditation training, corroborating
the assumption of a causal impact of meditation training on gray
matter concentration in this region. Results suggest that meditation
practice is associated with structural differences in regions that
are typically activated during meditation and in regions that are
relevant for the task of meditation.},

abstract = {Mindfulness is conceived as a state in which the individual pays full attention to everything that is happening around him or her. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is the most popular instrument for assessing mindfulness. Studies on its structure have shown some conflicting results. This study aims to offer new evidence on the dimensionality and reliability of the MAAS, handling both SEM and IRT procedures, in palliative professionals. The sample was composed of 385 professionals from a national online survey. First, two Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) were specified, estimated, and tested, with one- and two-factor structures, respectively. Second, the Graded Response Model (GRM) was used and accuracy of the MAAS using information functions was estimated. Results showed appropriate fit for the two CFA models. As the correlation between the two factors in the two-factor model was extremely high and the original authors posited a one-factor solution, this structure was retained for parsimony. The GRM also supported this structure, but found that the scale offered more information on professionals with lower levels of mindfulness, pointing at items 1, 2, 6, and 15 as the less discriminative, in line with the CFA lower factor loadings for these very same items.

abstract = {Local independence in the Rasch model can be violated in two generic
ways that are generally not distinguished clearly in the literature.
In this paper we distinguish between a violation of unidimensionality,
which we call trait dependence, and a specific violation of statistical
independence, which we call response dependence, both of which violate
local independence. Distinct algebraic formulations for trait and
response dependence are developed as violations of the dichotomous
Rasch model, data are simulated with varying degrees of dependence
according to these formulations, and then analysed according to the
Rasch model assuming no violations. Relative to the case of no violation
it is shown that trait and response dependence result in opposite
effects on the unit of scale as manifested in the range and standard
deviation of the scale and the standard deviation of person locations.
In the case of trait dependence the scale is reduced; in the case
of response dependence it is increased. Again, relative to the case
of no violation, the two violations also have opposite effects on
the person separation index (analogous to Cronbach's alpha reliability
index of traditional test theory in value and construction): it decreases
for data with trait dependence; it increases for data with response
dependence. A standard way of accounting for dependence is to combine
the dependent items into a higher-order polytomous item. This typically
results in a decreased person separation index index and Cronbach's
alpha, compared with analysing items as discrete, independent items.
This occurs irrespective of the kind of dependence in the data, and
so further contributes to the two violations not being distinguished
clearly. In an attempt to begin to distinguish between them statistically
this paper articulates the opposite effects of these two violations
in the dichotomous Rasch model.},

Such a fundamental change of human habits is likely to have generalized consequences for other basic fine motor skills as well. In this article, the authors provide evidence that the skill to produce precisely controlled arm-hand movements is related to the usage of computer keyboards in producing written text in everyday life. This result supports the notion that specific cultural skills such as handwriting and typing shape more general perceptual and motor skills. More generally, changing technologies are associated with generalized changes of the profile of basic human skills.},

We designed this resource to support students actively learning methodology in the classroom by providing instructors with an annotated bibliography of contemporary research to illustrate various research design elements in the context of topics that students will find engaging. Instructors can assign these articles as supplementary readings in order to provide a foundation for class discussion, activities, and critical thinking exercises. To facilitate this, each bibliographic entry includes in-class discussions starters that promote critical thinking as well as activities that use the research article as a foundation for developing new research questions and designs. The articles we selected for this resource illustrate various research designs as well as serve as examples of specific design features such as inter-rater reliability, the use of confederates, and other methods utilized in a variety of subject areas (e.g., sensation/perception, health psychology, social psychology, and neuroscience).

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) has been
developed as a 'unifying framework' for comparing and combining disparate
nursing data from across the world. In order to meet the increasingly
sophisticated needs of users of ICNP, substantial revision has been
made to the Beta 2 version of ICNP, culminating in the launch of
ICNP Version 1 in 2005. In its revision of ICNP, the development
team has followed a rigorous development process using current best
practice in ontology development. The core of ICNP Version 1 is represented
in the Web Ontology Language, the de facto standard ontology representation
language. An ontology editor, Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}}, and other software tools
have been used to support the process. The result is a robust terminological
resource that can accommodate existing and emerging nursing terminologies
and allow comparisons to be made between disparate nursing data.
The revision has provided ICNP with a sustainable foundation that
will a) facilitate further development and maintenance of ICNP and
b) extend significantly its functionality.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles.18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies.A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies},

abstract = {Abstract  The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

McGraw and Wong introduced this "common language effect size statistic" for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized CL to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case.In the current paper a different generalization of CL, called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations ofCL are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

It has advantages to visualize data with long axes or large amount of categories, described with different measurements. It is also effective to visualize relations between elements. Circos (http://circos.ca) is an extraordinarily cool tool to make such circular layout and it is broadly used in real applications, not just popular in Genomic but in a lot of other areas as well. It is not only a way to visualize data, but also enhances the representation of scientific results into a level of aesthetics. Therefore, most people call figures with circular layout as 'circos plot'. Here the circlize package 1 aims to implement Circos in R. One important advantage for the implementation in R is that R is an ideal environment which provides seamless connection between data analysis and data visualization. This package is not a front-end wrapper to generate configuration files for Circos, but completely coded in R style by using R's elegant statistical and graphic engine. We aim to keep the flexibility and configurability of Circos, also make the package more straightforward to use and enhance it to support more types of graphics.},

A major aim of the GOSAT lies in the utilization of different modes of measurement, (i.e., peer reports and observational data), in addition to self-reports which have been used predominantly in past behavioral genetic research on personality and temperament in adults. Participants completed a full day assessment at the University of Bielefeld including videotaped social interactions and presentations, psychometric intelligence tests and computerized elementary cognitive tasks as well as objective measures and unobtrusive behavior counts. The research design of the GOSAT was devised to reduce the potential impact of systematic rater bias on estimates of genetic and environmental influences to a minimum. In combination with extensive self- and peer report data on key personality and personality related dimensions available from the BiLSAT, the GOSAT provides a rich dataset, which currently includes DNA samples from 80% of its participants.},

abstract = {PURPOSE For healthcare terminologies to provide coverage of a domain,
many have evolved into very large and complex sets, creating a challenge
for implementation. The International Classification of Nursing Practice
(ICNP) Version 2 has over 2800 concepts. Thus, development of terminology
subsets is considered as a potential solution to facilitate implementation.
METHOD Based on early efforts to develop ICNP Catalogues, or clinically
relevant subsets of the terminology, a process model was developed
based on the ICNP life cycle. The steps involved in developing a
subset are (a) identifying client(s) and health priority, (b) gathering
terms and concepts relevant to a given priority, (c) mapping the
identified concepts to the ICNP terminology, (d) modeling new concepts,
(e) finalizing a Catalogue, and (f) disseminating the Catalogue.
RESULTS The ICNP model was applied to subset development resulting
in three ICNP Catalogues: (a) Partnering with Patients and Families
to Promote Adherence to Treatment, (b) Palliative Care for Dignified
Dying, and (c) Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and
Care. Although the three Catalogues were very different in the focus
of health priority addressed, there are overlapping concepts across
the Catalogues ranging from 1.0 to 14.2%. CONCLUSION The ICNP process
model for Catalogue development can be used by other terminology
developers and potentially assist in the creation of subset of ICNP
to be used at the electronic health record interface. Further research
is needed to address challenges and implications for testing and
applications of terminology subsets.},

In Experiment 1, our confederate cheated ostentatiously by finishing a task impossibly quickly and leaving the room with the maximum reward. In line with social-norms theory, participants' level of unethical behavior increased when the confederate was an in-group member, but decreased when the confederate was an out-group member. In Experiment 2, our confederate instead asked a question about cheating, which merely strengthened the saliency of this possibility. This manipulation decreased the level of unethical behavior among the other group members. These results suggest that individuals' unethicality does not depend on the simple calculations of cost-benefit analysis, but rather depends on the social norms implied by the dishonesty of others and also on the saliency of dishonesty.},

abstract = {The linear factor analysis (FA) model is a popular tool for exploratory data analysis or, more precisely, for assessing the dimensionality of sets of items. Although it is well known that it is meant for continuous observed indica- tors, it is often used with dichotomous, ordinal, and other types of discrete variables, yielding results that might be incorrect. Not only parameter es- timates may be biased, but also goodness-of-fit indices cannot be trusted. Magidson and Vermunt (2001) presented a nonlinear factor-analytic model based on latent class (LC) analysis that is especially suited for dealing with categorical indicators, such as dichotomous, ordinal, and nominal variables,and counts. The approach is called latent class factor analysis (LCFA) be- cause it combines elements from LC and traditional FA. This LCFA model is one of the LC models implemented in the Latent GOLD program (Vermunt & Magidson, 2000, 2003). A disadvantage of the LCFA model is, however, that its parameters may be somewhat more difficult to interpret than the typical factor-analytic co- efficients – factor loadings , factor-item correlations, factor correlations, and communalities . In order to overcome this problem, we propose using a linear approximation of the maximum likelihood estimates obtained with a LCFA model. This makes it possible to provide the same type of output measures as in standard FA, while retaining the fact that the underlying factor structure is identified by the more reliable nonlinear factor-analytic model.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to explore the representation
of knowledge among nurses and midwives in a maternal and obstetrics
setting, in a hospital in northern Portugal. The research had two
main objectives: to contribute to the identification and definition
of concepts that represent nursing knowledge in obstetrics and to
participate in the validation of the International Classification
for Nursing Practice (ICNP){\textregistered}. METHODS Using a qualitative approach,
the study was designed in three phases. The first phase aimed to
identify the terms and expressions used by nurses in nursing documentation
and oral report, using document analysis, observation and interview
as data collection methods. The second phase intended to determine
which terms and expressions corresponded to ICNP{\textregistered} concepts. The
third phase aimed to analyse the definition of some ICNP{\textregistered} concepts.
In both the second and third phases, a consensus approach was used
based on the Delphi Technique. ICNP{\textregistered} concepts were identified from
the words and expressions used by nurses and midwives to describe
their practice. RESULTS The results of this study suggested modifications
on some ICNP{\textregistered} concept definitions, namely burping, bonding, mother-child
attachment, infant sucking, false labour pain, aborting, and uterine
contraction; and the inclusion of specific characteristics in others,
i.e. uterine expulsion, breast engorgement, colic, and hunger. New
ICNP{\textregistered} concepts were also suggested, specifically mother-foetal attachment,
uterine contraction after labour, pain after labour and foetal well-being.
CONCLUSION The study confirmed that ICNP{\textregistered} is an important instrument
to identify the concepts needed to describe mother and child needs
during the perinatal period.},

@article{Shaw1991,
abstract = {Descriptive IRT vs. Prescriptive Rasch Item response theory (IRT) generally refers to three probabilistic measurement models: the 1-parameter (identical to the dichotomous Rasch model), the 2-parameter, and the 3-parameter, named by the number of item parameters estimated in each model. All three models can be specified from a single probabilistic function for the occurrence of a right answer by a person to an item: P(x=1) = ci - (1-ci) exp (ai(t-bi)) / (1 + exp (ai(t-bi))) where the three item parameters are ci = low asymptote of ogive (guessing) bi = median intercept of ogive (difficulty) ai = slope of ogive at inflection (discrimination) and the one person parameter is t = ability of a person on the variable. Making ci constant produces 2-parameter estimation. Making ai constant produces 1-parameter estimation. This approach seems to imply that the Rasch model is just a stripped- down version of more complicated models which "must be better" because they account for more of the "presumed reality" of traditional test theory. Quite apart from Occam's razor (that entities are not multiplied beyond necessity), this interpretation is shallow in an essential way. That the Rasch model can be reached by simplifying more complicated models has nothing to do with its genesis or rationale, or with the theory of measurement. The Rasch model is not intended to fit data or to be evaluated by how well it fits any particular data set. The Rasch model is a definition of measurement derived from the universally accepted measurement requirements that: 1. The measures of objects be free of the particulars of the agents used to estimate these measures and the calibrations of agents be free of the particulars of the objects used to estimate these calibrations. 2. The measures of objects and calibrations of agents function according to the rules of arithmetic on a common scale so that they can be analyzed statistically. 3. Linear combinations of measures and calibrations correspond to plausible concatenations of objects and agents. Introducing the superfluous parameters, ai and ci, violates these requirements and disqualifies the resulting contrivances as "measurement" models. Were the values of t known prior to analysis, the 2- and 3-parameter formulations could be used to specify two, among many possible, logistic regressions, as they have been in biometric analysis for 60 years. When t is not known and must be estimated from the same data, as is the case for measurement, then it can be demonstrated algebraically that the parameter estimates must diverge unless constrained in an arbitrary manner. In practice, arbitrary interference, such as limiting the range of ai and ci, does not produce sample-free item calibrations or test-free person measures - unless ai and ci are restricted to constants, when, of course, the formulation becomes a Rasch model and functions accordingly. This is the misunderstanding of those who claim the 2- and 3-parameter computer programs "work". In the few instances where serious 2- and 3-parameter results are reported, their quality is proportional to the extent to which ai and ci were kept from varying - from being influenced by the data. Indeed all important practical IRT applications reported at the 1991 AERA meeting were implemented by the Rasch model. In theory and in practice, the Rasch model is a unique measurement archetype.},

Das wollte er und sch mte sich nicht daf r, vom Haben und vom Sein schrieb er und von der Chance, die es gebe, der Diktatur des Habens zu entfliehen, er schrieb es in einer Zeit, als das h ssliche Wort Gutmenschentum noch nicht erfunden war, das heute alles zu ersticken vermag, was nach utopischem Denken klingt. Es war 1976, als Haben oder Sein`` erschien, das Jahr der Dioxin-Katastrophe in Seveso, das Jahr der ersten gro en Brokdorf-Demonstration: Der Psychoanalytiker, Philosoph, Sozialforscher Erich Fromm, 1900 geboren, schrieb sein sp tes Werk hinein in eine Zeit, die sehr empf nglich daf r war. Jene Zeit, als auf B cherregalen die blauen Marx-Engels-B nde zur Seite ger ckt wurden, um Platz zu schaffen f r die Texte der Frauen-, der Schwulen-, der Alternativbewegung; als die Bibliografien geisteswissenschaftlicher Werke zwangsl ufig mit A wie Adorno begannen; Fromm stand nicht in jeder Literaturliste, doch im Gegensatz zu Adorno, seinem Mitstreiter und Rivalen aus dem legend ren Frankfurter Institut f r Sozialforschung, wurde er tats chlich gelesen. Gelesen und zitiert und zu Tode paraphrasiert, seine Kunst des Liebens`` vor allem, 1956 erschienen und millionenfach verkauft. Nicht klammern, loslassen, zu sich selber finden, jenes Siebziger-Jahre-Begleitgemurmel f r Beziehungsdiskussion und Gesellschaftsanalyse, h ufig fand es seine Quellen in den Schriften des Sozialwissenschaftlers Fromm, was ihm den Ruf des weichgesp lten Kuschelphilosophen verschaffte, den man schlie lich nicht mehr lesen mochte, sehr zu Unrecht, wie ein frischer Blick auf sein Werk erschlie t. Haben oder Sein - Die seelischen Grundlagen einer neuen Gesellschaft`` schrieb er im Tessin lebend, nach Europa zur ckgekehrt aus jahrzehntelangem Exil in Mexiko und den USA, den ersten Herzinfarkt hatte er hinter sich, es blieb sein letzter gro er Text. Haben und Sein - zwei substantivierte Verben, aus denen eine Weltsicht entsteht. Zwei Menschentypen, zwei Gesellschaftstypen besiedeln die Welt: Das Haben entspricht dem Geist einer nekrophilen Gesellschaft, die tote Dinge verehrt, w hrend die biophile Gesellschaft des Seins den Menschen als ihren Mittelpunkt begreift. Fromm schrieb das in eine Zeit hinein, die begann, ber die Grenzen des Wachstums`` zu diskutieren, der erste Bericht des Club of Rome war erschienen, das britische Atomkraftwerk Sellafield, war knapp an einer Katastrophe vorbeigeschrammt, er schrieb es in einer Welt des Habens, so befand er, die ihre Lebensgrundlagen vernichtet und sich nur ndern kann, wenn sich auch die Psyche des Menschen ndert, der in ihr lebt. Scharfsichtig und sehr aktuell seine Analyse des Marketing-Charakters`` des modernen Menschen, schon in den vierziger Jahren hat er sie entwickelt, nun f hrt er sie n her aus: Alles ist abgestellt auf vor bergehende Befriedigung, auf Verschlei . Der Konsument, jener ewige S ugling, der nach der Flasche schreit``, kennzeichnet diese Welt des Habens, kurzfristig nur identifiziert er sich mit modernen Gebrauchsgegenst nden, deren wesentliche Eigenschaft es ist, berholt und beseitigt zu werden. Alles ist austauschbar, Dinge, Meinungen, Einstellungen, Freunde, Liebespartner, und der Mensch selbst beginnt sein konstantes Selbst einzub en, wird zur Ware auf dem Pers nlichkeitsmarkt``, die sich vorteilhaft pr sentieren muss, die sich selbst verkauft: Ich bin, was ich habe, und was ich habe, hat mich. Als Vision setzt er dagegen eine Welt des Seins. Aus Marx und Buddha und Jesus und Freud speist sich diese Vision, dazu Spinoza und Meister Eckhart, er sagt: Es gibt Hoffnung, die Welt ist ver nderbar. Fromm ist der Erfinder der Analytischen Sozialphilosophie, er war von 1930 an Mitarbeiter in Max Horkheimers Institut f r Sozialforschung und bis zum Zerw rfnis im Exil in den sp ten drei iger Jahren eine der pr genden Pers nlichkeiten der Frankfurter Schule, und er hat eine andere Botschaft als die pessimistische seiner Kollegen. Sp ttisch zitiert wurde im Institut gern ein Spruch, der ihn seit seiner Jugend begleitete: Lieber Gott, mach mich wie Erich Fromm, dass ich in den Himmel komm.`` Was ungerecht ist, denn Fromm sagt nicht: Alles wird gut. Er sagt, dass die Chancen gering bleiben, da es zu den notwendigen menschlichen und gesellschaftlichen Ver nderungen kommt``. Aber er sagt auch, beides sei im Menschen angelegt, das Sein und das Haben, und stark beeinflusst werde er durch den Charakter der Gesellschaft, in der er lebt. Beides m sse ver ndert werden, der Mensch und die Gesellschaft, und bei beidem lohne der Versuch - was ermutigender klingt als die Botschaft Adornos, derzufolge es kein richtiges Leben im falschen geben kann. Konturen der k nftigen Gesellschaft hat Fromm entworfen, manches davon wirkt wie im 21. Jahrhundert verfasst, der Aufruf zum Verbraucherboykott als gesellschaftspolitischem Druckmittel beispielsweise, die Forderung nach einem garantierten j hrlichen Mindesteinkommen f r jeden B rger, das liest sich wie Beitr ge zu den aktuellen Debatten der Republik. Anderes erscheint merkw rdig heute, abwegiger, seine Idee beispielsweise, einen Kulturrat`` ins Leben zu rufen, ein Gremium aus Vertretern der geistigen und k nstlerischen Elite des Landes, aus M nnern und Frauen, deren Integrit t ber jeden Zweifel erhaben ist`` - w rde man sie finden? Oder die Idee, ein System zur Verbreitung von echten Fakten und alternativen Denkans tzen, von objektiven Informationen`` zu etablieren - gibt es die? Es ist mehr der Blick aufs Ganze, der bei Fromm fasziniert, sein Ansatz, nicht nur das Individuum, sondern die Gesellschaft mit dem Blick des Psychoanalytikers zu studieren, und einer der interessantesten Aspekte daran ist sein Umgang mit dem Begriff Religion``. Fromm, ein Kind aus j disch-orthodoxem Hause, der sich, als er die Psychoanalyse entdeckt hat, entfernt von der Orthodoxie - er ist der Meinung, dass jede Gesellschaft eine Grundkonstante hat, ohne die sie nicht funktioniert: Sie muss das allen Menschen eigene religi se Bed rfnis erf llen``. Er meint nicht ein Glaubenssystem, das notwendigerweise mit einem Gottesbegriff operiert. Er meint jedes System des Denkens und Handelns, das dem Einzelnen einen Rahmen der Orientierung und ein Objekt der Hingabe bietet``. Hingabe an B ume, an Idole aus Gold, einen unsichtbaren Gott. An eine Nation, an eine Klasse, eine Partei, an eine ungefesselte Marktwirtschaft, an Geld oder Erfolg, all das ist f r ihn Religion, er fragt nicht Religion oder nicht Religion``, er fragt welche Religion``, und ob sie einen zerst rerischen Charakter f r die menschliche Gesellschaft hat. Er stellt die Ketzerfrage, ob die westliche Gesellschaft wirklich so christlich ist, wie sie sich d nkt - ihn erinnert die Verkl rung des Wettstreits, des Siegenm ssens in der Marktwirtschaft nicht an die Botschaft Jesu, unser Vorbild, sagt er, ist immer noch der heidnische Held``. Seine eigene Religion, die des radikalen Humanismus``, mag manchem gestrig erscheinen. Sie ist es nicht. Nachwort von Barbara Supp zu emphHaben oder Sein. SPIEGEL-Edition Band 28},

The statistic, the common language effect size indicator, is easily calculated from sample means and variances (or from proportions in the case of nominal-level data). It can be used for expressing the effect observed in both independent and related sample designs and in both 2-group and n-group designs. Empirical tests show it to be robust to violations of the normality assumption, particularly when the variances in the 2 parent distributions are equal.(C) 1992 by the American Psychological Association},

Although the benefits of practice tests are well documented, the mechanisms underlying testing effects are not well understood. We propose the mediator effectiveness hypothesis, which states that more-effective mediators (that is, information linking cues to targets) are generated during practice involving tests with restudy versus during restudy only. Effective mediators must be retrievable at time of test and must elicit the target response. We evaluated these two components of mediator effectiveness for learning foreign language translations during practice involving either test-restudy or restudy only. Supporting the mediator effectiveness hypothesis, test-restudy practice resulted in mediators that were more likely to be retrieved and more likely to elicit targets on a final test.},

What happens when people cannot reciprocate, but instead have the chance to be cruel or kind to someone entirely different--to pay it forward? In 5 experiments, participants received greedy, equal, or generous divisions of money or labor from an anonymous person and then divided additional resources with a new anonymous person. While equal treatment was paid forward in kind, greed was paid forward more than generosity. This asymmetry was driven by negative affect, such that a positive affect intervention disrupted the tendency to pay greed forward. Implications for models of generalized reciprocity are discussed.},

system (SNOMED-CT) using the methodology developed by Lu and colleagues
to detect misassigned concepts. Knowledge representation concepts
in the NIC and SNOMED-CT systems were compared using expert human
judgment. Of 514 NIC concepts, 14 (2.7%) were identified as misassigned
in SNOMED-CT. Two inappropriate representations of concepts were
discovered in NIC. Results and recommendations were given to NIC
and to SNOMED-CT. (C) 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Observers rated the physical attractiveness of 74 defendants in a criminal court, covering a broad range of offenses.  Seventy-three usable cases were obtained.  For 67 defendants (excluding those who had drawn "flat sentences" off 99 - 199 years), attractiveness was predictive of both minimum and maximum sentences (p < .001)-the more attractive the defendant, the less severe the sentence imposed.  No significant relationship was found  between attractiveness and conviction/acquittal, although seriousness of the crime was found to correlate negatively with attractiveness (p <.01).   Race of the defendant showed a systematic relationship to punishment, with nonwhites drawing consistently more severe sentences than whites; a multiple regression analysis  using attractiveness, race, and seriousness of crime as predictors of punishment yielded results which implied that this finding was largely due to a confounding of race and seriousness of the crime.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: . To describe the development of the Patient Experiences Questionnaire (PEQ) and to evaluate reliability and validity of constructed summed rating scales. DESIGN: Literature review, focus groups and pilot surveys. Two national cross-sectional studies performed in 1996 and 1998. SETTING: Two postal surveys in a national sample of 14 hospitals stratified by geographical region and hospital size. Subjects. Patients consecutively discharged from surgical wards and wards of internal medicine. The surveys included 36 845 patients and 19 578 responded (53%). RESULTS: We constructed 10 summed rating scales based on factor analysis and theoretical considerations: Information on future complaints, Nursing services, Communication, Information examinations, Contact with next-of-kin, Doctor services, Hospital and equipment, Information medication, Organization and General satisfaction. Eight scales had a Cronbach alpha coefficient of >0.70, the remaining two were >0.60. Repeatability was >0.70 for five scales and >0.60 for the remaining scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PEQ is a self-report instrument covering the most important subjects of interest to hospital patients. Results are presented as 10 scales with good validity and reliability. It emphasizes practicability and comprehensibility while at the same time providing sufficient information about domains applicable to most patients admitted to medical and surgical wards.},

abstract = {Multitasking negatively influences the retention of information over brief periods of time. This impact of interference on working memory is exacerbated with normal aging. We used functional MRI to investigate the neural basis by which an interruption is more disruptive to working memory performance in older individuals. Younger and older adults engaged in delayed recognition tasks both with and without interruption by a secondary task. Behavioral analysis revealed that working memory performance was more impaired by interruptions in older compared with younger adults. Functional connectivity analyses showed that when interrupted, older adults disengaged from a memory maintenance network and reallocated attentional resources toward the interrupting stimulus in a manner consistent with younger adults. However, unlike younger individuals, older adults failed to both disengage from the interruption and reestablish functional connections associated with the disrupted memory network. These results suggest that multitasking leads to more significant working memory disruption in older adults because of an interruption recovery failure, manifest as a deficient ability to dynamically switch between functional brain networks. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of an acute stretching intervention
on knee extension range of motion, passive resistive torque and stiffness
in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee, and to compare these
variables with subjects without osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional
experimental study. SETTING: Human performance laboratory. PARTICIPANTS:
A total of 55 participants were recruited: 28 subjects (males and
females) with osteoarthritis of the knee joint and 27 subjects of
a similar age without osteoarthritis of the knee joint. INTERVENTION:
Using the Kincom dynamometer, three 60-second stretches with 60seconds
of rest between stretches were applied to the hamstring muscle group.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peak knee extension range of motion, peak
passive torque and stiffness in the final 10% of knee extension range
of motion. RESULTS: A significant (P<0.05) increase in knee extension
range of motion, peak passive torque and stiffness was observed in
both groups. For knee extension range of motion, the mean difference
for the osteoarthritis group and non-osteoarthritis group was 4.9
degrees [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 8.5] and 4.4 degrees
(95% CI 1.8 to 6.8), respectively. For peak passive torque, the mean
difference in the osteoarthritis group and the non-osteoarthritis
group was 4.4Nm (95% CI 0.8 to 6.9) and 1.0Nm (95% CI -1.4 to 3.5),
respectively. For stiffness in the final 10% of knee extension range
of motion, the mean difference for the osteoarthritis group and the
non-osteoarthritis group was 0.19Nm/degree (95% CI 0.08 to 0.3) and
0.04Nm/degree (95% CI -0.05 to 0.1), respectively. Stiffness in the
final 10% of knee extension range of motion was significantly higher
in the osteoarthritis group compared with the non-osteoarthritis
group after stretching. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals with and
without osteoarthritis of the knee are able to demonstrate immediate
beneficial adaptations to a stretching intervention. This is important
as stretching is often used in preparation for exercise programmes.},

abstract = {Quitting smoking is a major life stressor that results in numerous aversive consequences, including persistently increased level of post-cessation negative affect and relapse. The identification of factors that may enhance behavioral and emotional regulation after quitting may be useful in enhancing quit rates and preventing relapse. One factor broadly linked with behavioral and emotional regulation is mindfulness. This study examined baseline associations of mindfulness with demographic variables, smoking history, dependence, withdrawal severity, and agency among 158 smokers enrolled in a cessation trial. Results indicated that mindfulness was negatively associated with level of nicotine dependence and withdrawal severity, and positively associated with a sense of agency regarding cessation. Moreover, mindfulness remained significantly associated with these measures even after controlling for key demographic variables. Results suggest that low level of mindfulness may be an important predictor of vulnerability to relapse among adult smokers preparing to quit; thus, mindfulness-based interventions may enhance cessation.},

We conducted a cross-sectional as well as a two-week-diary study with 35 dual-earner couples (N = 70 working adults, 51.3 % married). Besides work-family conflict, we measured variables such as subjective involvement in the work and family domains, emotional well-being, and personal goals. Work-family conflicts were partly interdependent between the two partners: everyday conflicts due to negative influences of the partnership domain were positively interrelated. Work-family conflict were mainly predicted by psychological variables (e. g., subjective involvement in the professional domain), whereas sociodemographic parameters (e. g., gender) were of minor importance. Cross-sectionally as well as processually work-family conflicts were related to negative emotions. Positive emotions were mainly influenced by individual goal progress and by perceiving the partner as content and supportive.

Das Verfahren: Der SF-36 ist ein krankheits{\"{u}}bergreifendes Messinstrument zur Erfassung der gesundheitsbezogenen Lebensqualit{\"{a}}t von Patienten, welcher aus 36 Items besteht. Er erfasst acht Dimensionen der subjektiven Gesundheit: K{\"{o}}rperliche Funktionsf{\"{a}}higkeit, K{\"{o}}rperliche Rollenfunktion, K{\"{o}}rperliche Schmerzen, Allgemeine Gesundheitswahrnehmung, Vitalit{\"{a}}t, Soziale Funktionsf{\"{a}}higkeit, Emotionale Rollenfunktion und Psychisches Wohlbefinden, die sich den Grunddimensionen K{\"{o}}rperliche und Psychische Gesundheit zuordnen lassen. Mit einem Einzelitem wird zus{\"{a}}tzlich der aktuelle Gesundheitszustand im Vergleich zum vergangenen Jahr erfragt. Mit dem SF-12 steht eine {\"{o}}konomische Kurzform zur Verf{\"{u}}gung. Sowohl SF-36 als auch SF-12 liegen in jeweils sechs Versionen vor: Die Akutversion bezieht sich auf die vergangene Woche und die Standardversion auf die vergangenen vier Wochen. Beide Versionen k{\"{o}}nnen als Fragebogen oder als Interview durchgef{\"{u}}hrt werden, wobei jeweils zwischen Selbstbeurteilung und Fremdbeurteilung gew{\"{a}}hlt werden kann. Dem Manual liegt eine CD-ROM bei. Diese enth{\"{a}}lt die Rohdaten der deutschen Normstichprobe aus dem Jahre 1994 sowie Eingabe- und Syntaxdateien f{\"{u}}r die Auswertung mit SPSS oder SAS, f{\"{u}}r deren Benutzung auf dem Computer SPSS oder SAS installiert sein muss. F{\"{u}}r die 2., erg{\"{a}}nzte und {\"{u}}berarbeitete Auflage des SF-36 wurden die Normwerte vollst{\"{a}}ndig neu berechnet. Dabei wurde auf eine entsprechende Alters- und Regionalgewichtung R{\"{u}}cksicht genommen. In allen Normtabellen wurden die Werte der beiden Summenskalen neu integriert. Es wurden zus{\"{a}}tzliche, ausf{\"{u}}hrliche Hinweise f{\"{u}}r die Auswertung in das Manual aufgenommen. Erstmalig ist die Auswertung per Hand mit einem Auswertungsbogen m{\"{o}}glich. Zuverl{\"{a}}ssigkeit: Die internen Konsistenzen (Cronbachs Alpha) der Subskalen liegen in verschiedenen Stichproben mehrheitlich deutlich {\"{u}}ber .70. Einzig die Subskalen Allgemeine Gesundheitswahrnehmung und Soziale Funktionsf{\"{a}}higkeit lagen in einigen Stichproben zwischen $\alpha$ = .57 und $\alpha$ = .69. G{\"{u}}ltigkeit: Es werden umfangreiche Studien zur konvergenten, diskriminanten Validit{\"{a}}t und Sensitivit{\"{a}}t des Verfahrens angef{\"{u}}hrt. Normen: Es liegen Normdaten f{\"{u}}r Deutschland aus der repr{\"{a}}sentativen Bev{\"{o}}lkerungsstichprobe von 1994 (N = 2.914), aus dem Bundesgesundheitssurvey von 1998 (N = 6.967) sowie nur f{\"{u}}r den SF-12 f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}sterreich aus der Steirischen Gesundheitsbefragung von 1999 (N = 5.169) vor.

For the Mann-Whitney U, the evidence consists of pairs. For the signed-rank test, the evidence consists of rank sums. Also, the formula applies to the Binomial Effect Size Display. The formula r = f – u means that a correlation r can yield a prediction so that the proportion correct is f and the proportion incorrect is u.},

is valid for measuring an attribute if (a) the attribute exists and

validity theory in several respects. In particular, the emphasis
in the proposed conception is on ontology, reference, and causality,
whereas current validity theory focuses on epistemology, meaning,
and correlation. It is argued that the proposed conception is not
only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken
in the existing literature. Further, it has clear theoretical and
practical implications for validation research. Most important, validation
research must not be directed at the relation between the measured
attribute and other attributes but at the processes that convey the
effect of the measured attribute on the test scores.},

@article{Sandelowski2008,
abstract = {AIM: This paper offers a discussion of the reading and writing practices that define systematic review.

BACKGROUND: Although increasingly popular, systematic review has engendered a critique of the claims made for it as a more objective method for summing up research findings than other kinds of reviews.

DISCUSSION: An alternative understanding of systematic review is as a highly subjective, albeit disciplined, engagement between resisting readers and resistant texts. Reviewers of research exemplify the resisting reader when they exclude reports on grounds of relevance, quality, or methodological difference. Research reports exemplify resistant texts as they do not simply yield their findings, but rather must be made docile to review. These acts of resistance make systematic review possible, but challenge claims of its greater capacity to control bias.

CONCLUSION: An understanding of the reading and writing practices that define systematic review still holds truth and objectivity as regulative ideals, but is aware of the reading and writing practices that both enable and challenge those ideals.},

abstract = {Mindfulness meditation practices (MMPs) are a subgroup of meditation practices which are receiving growing attention. The present paper reviews current evidence about the effects of MMPs on objective measures of cognitive functions. Five databases were searched. Twenty three studies providing measures of attention, memory, executive functions and further miscellaneous measures of cognition were included. Fifteen were controlled or randomized controlled studies and 8 were case-control studies. Overall, reviewed studies suggested that early phases of mindfulness training, which are more concerned with the development of focused attention, could be associated with significant improvements in selective and executive attention whereas the following phases, which are characterized by an open monitoring of internal and external stimuli, could be mainly associated with improved unfocused sustained attention abilities. Additionally, MMPs could enhance working memory capacity and some executive functions. However, many of the included studies show methodological limitations and negative results have been reported as well, plausibly reflecting differences in study design, study duration and patients' populations. Accordingly, even though findings here reviewed provided preliminary evidence suggesting that MMPs could enhance cognitive functions, available evidence should be considered with caution and further high quality studies investigating more standardized mindfulness meditation programs are needed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The lecture was brilliant, bold and controversial. It generated much discussion and some criticism, but it did stimulate the audience, which included the reviewer. The historical account of the breakdown in communications between mathematicians and physicists and of the lack of interest in Maxwell's equations constitutes an indictment of the mathematical community. The discovery of the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the Lorentz group had to wait for Minkowski, and some of its simple consequences for Cartan, Weyl and Einstein. Grassmann's "Ausdehnungslehre'', Hamilton's quaternions, and Feynman sums constitute some of the remaining examples of opportunities which the mathematicians have missed, or are perhaps still missing. The lecture closed with an appropriate reference to Hadamard.},

abstract = {Eine empirische Beforschung des Achtsamkeitskonzepts erfordert auch die Erfassung des Konstruktes selbst. Ob dies prinzipiell mit dem gegebenen metho- dischen Inventar der Psychologie m{\"{o}}glich ist, wird kurz diskutiert. Zwei bereits im eng- lischen Sprachraum existierende Instrumente werden skizziert, bevor die Konstruktion und Validierung des Freiburger Fragebogens zur Achtsamkeit (FFA) beschrieben wird. Zun{\"{a}}chst wurde auf der Basis einer Literaturstudie und anschlie{\ss}ender Bewertung durch ExpertInnen ein Fragebogen mit 38 Items erarbeitet. Dieser wurde an Stichproben von 115 TeilnehmerInnen an einem Vipassana-Retreat jeweils vor und nach dem Retreat aus- gef{\"{u}}llt. Aus diesen Daten konnte die 30-Item-Langform des FFA gebildet werden, die mit einer internen Konsistenz von r = .93 und einer Vierfaktorenstruktur gute psychometri- sche Kennwerte aufweist. In einer weiteren Validierungsstudie wurde diese Langform an drei Stichproben ausgege- ben: 65 Personen, die an Achtsamkeitskursen teilnahmen, 86 Personen, die keine weiteren Verbindungen zu buddhistischen oder Meditationskonzepten hatten, sowie an eine klini- sche Stichprobe von 117 Personen. Die Stichprobe der Normalbev{\"{o}}lkerung wies f{\"{u}}r einige Items eine geringe Trennsch{\"{a}}rfe auf. Offensichtlich werden diese nur von Menschen, die mit dem Achtsamkeitskonzept vertraut sind, semantisch verstanden. L{\"{a}}sst man diese schwierigen Items weg, ergibt sich eine semantisch und psychometrisch robuste Kurzform mit 14 Items (a = .87). In einer Faktorenanalyse zeigte sich hier anstatt der Vierfaktoren- struktur ein Generalfaktor. Die Korrelation mit anderen Skalen ergab eine {\"{u}}berzeugende Validierung. Das Instrument korreliert positiv mit privater Selbstaufmerksamkeit (r = .29) und Selbstkenntnis (r = .55), jedoch negativ mit Dissoziation (r = –.29) und psychi- scher Belastung (r = –40).},

abstract = {—A powerful way of improving one's memory for material is to be tested on that material. Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surpris- ing phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving re- tention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assess- ment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally,we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An important objective of epidemiological research is to identify risk factors for disease. Depending on the particular question being asked, cohort studies, case-control studies, or cross-sectional studies are conducted. METHODS: Methods of data analysis in different types of epidemiological studies are illustrated through examples with fictive data. Important measures of frequency and effect will be introduced. Different regression models will be presented as examples of complex analytical methods. RESULTS: Important frequency measures in cohort studies are incidence and mortality. Important effect measures such as the relative risk (RR), hazard ratio (HR), standardized incidence ratio (SIR), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and odds ratio (OR) can also be calculated. In case-control or cross-sectional studies, the OR can be calculated as an effect measure. In cross-sectional studies, prevalence is the most important frequency measure. The interpretation of different frequency measures and effect measures will be discussed. CONCLUSION: The measures to be calculated and the analyses to be performed in an epidemiological study depend on the research questions being asked, the study type, and the available data.},

Summarizing the thoughts outlined above, the authors stress three aspects that papers reporting validation studies should follow: (1) The trait to be measured should be clearly defined and embedded within a nomological network. (2) Besides convergent validity, discriminant validity is important in order to gain a more complete picture of the validity of an instrument. To this end, different traits have to be assessed with different methods. The nomological network should guide the selection of the discriminant trait(s). (3) Effects of method variance should be modeled. This Editorial also suggests the need for more research in the areas of method variance producing, phenomena effects of item context, and the facet structure underlying and defining broad domains.

To investigate whether the simian light reflex is a reasonable model for the human light reflex, we elicited pupillary responses in three behaving rhesus macaques. We measured the change in pupillary area in response to brief (100 ms), intermediate (1 s), and long (3–5 s) light flashes delivered by light-emitting diodes while the monkey fixated a stationary target. Individual responses in the same monkey to either 100-ms or 1-s stimuli of the same light intensity were quite variable. Nevertheless, in response to the 100-ms stimulus, average pupillary constriction and peak constriction velocity increased and latency decreased linearly with the log of stimulus luminance. The minimum average constriction latency across monkeys for the brightest flash was 136 ms. A linear decrease of constriction latency with stimulus luminance also occurs in humans, but their latencies are ∼70 ms longer. In addition, peak constriction velocity was highly correlated with the decrease in pupillary area. Dilation metrics were not as well related to stimulus luminance as were constriction metrics. The latency from flash offset to the onset of dilation was relatively constant, averaging ∼480 ms. Peak dilation velocity was also correlated, but less well, with the increase in pupillary area. Constriction generally was greater and of longer duration for 1-s light pulses than for 100-ms pulses of equal luminance. The initial time courses of the responses to the two stimuli of different durations were identical until ∼150 ms after response onset. Human pupillary responses for long and short flashes also have identical initial time courses. For very long (3–5 s) and very bright constant-luminance stimuli, the simian pupil underwent oscillations at frequencies of 0.9–1.6 Hz. Similar oscillations, called hippus, occur in the human pupillary light reflex. Like humans, the monkeys also exhibited consensual and binocular pupillary responses. Except for response latency, the pupillary responses in the two primate species are otherwise quite similar. Therefore any knowledge we gain about the neuronal substrate of the simian light reflex can be expected to have considerable relevance when extrapolated to humans.

In the first study (N = 372), the psychometric properties of Positivity Scale (P Scale) were examined in accordance with classical test theory using a large number of college participants. In Study 2, the unidimensionality of the P Scale was corroborated with confirmatory factor analysis in 2 independent samples (N₁ = 322; N₂ = 457). In Study 3, P Scale invariance across sexes and its relations with self-esteem, life satisfaction, optimism, positive negative affect, depression, and the Big Five provided further evidence of the internal and construct validity of the new measure in a large community sample (N = 3,589). In Study 4, test-retest reliability of the P Scale was found in a sample of college students (N = 262) who were readministered the scale after 5 weeks. In Study 5, measurement invariance and construct validity of P Scale were further supported across samples in different countries and cultures, including Italy (N = 689), the United States (N = 1,187), Japan (N = 281), and Spain (N = 302). Psychometric findings across diverse cultural context attest to the robustness of the P Scale and to positivity as a basic disposition.},

The framework, derived primarily from Bandura′s (1986) general social cognitive theory, emphasizes the means by which individuals exercise personal agency in the career development process, as well as extra-personal factors that enhance or constrain agency. In particular, we focus on self-efficacy, expected outcome, and goal mechanisms and how they may interrelate with other person (e.g., gender), contextual (e.g., support system), and experiential/learning factors. Twelve sets of propositions are offered to organize existing findings and guide future research on the theory. We also present a meta-analysis of relevant findings and suggest specific directions for future empirical and theory-extension activity.},

DESIGN: Selection and translation of questionnaire's items; definition of response scale and demographic questions. Evaluation of face and content validity, feasibility, factor structure, reliability and construct validity. SETTING: Forty-one community pharmacies of the province of Santa Fe. Argentina. PARTICIPANTS: Questionnaire administered to patients receiving pharmaceutical care or traditional pharmacy services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pilot test to assess feasibility. Factor analysis used principal components and varimax rotation. Reliability established using internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity determined with extreme group method. RESULTS: A self-administered questionnaire with 27 items, 5-point Likert response scale and demographic questions was designed considering multidimensional structure of patient satisfaction. Questionnaire evaluates cumulative experience of patients with comprehensive pharmaceutical care practice in community pharmacies. Two hundred and seventy-four complete questionnaires were obtained. Factor analysis resulted in three factors: Managing therapy, Interpersonal relationship and General satisfaction, with a cumulative variance of 62.51%. Cronbach's alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.96, and 0.95, 0.88 and 0.76 for the three factors, respectively. Mann-Whitney test for construct validity did not showed significant differences between pharmacies that provide pharmaceutical care and those that do not, however, 23 items showed significant differences between the two groups of pharmacies. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire developed can be a reliable and valid instrument to assess patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies in Spanish. Further research is needed to deepen the validation process.},
