Many tools exist for academic writing including the notorious W.O.R.D.; but many more are out there. Let's have a look at those tools, and discuss what's important (what we expect the tools to deliver, eg., beautiful typesetting).


# Typical tools for academic writing

- *MS Word*: A "classical" choice, relied upon by myriads of white collar workers... I myself have used it extensively for academic writing; the main advantage being its simplicity, that is, well, everybody knows it, and knows more or less how to handle it. It's widespread use is of course an advantage.

- TeX: The purist's choice. The learning curve can be steep, but its beauty and elegance of typesetting if unreached.

- *Overleaf*, *Authorea*: Web-based apps that make it easy to enjoy modern functionality by making the entry hurdle as low as possible. These riches do not come for free; commercial organizations would like to see some return of investment.

- *Full*: With the "full" approach I refer to a blended version of several tools, mainly:
    - R
    - RStudio
    - RMarkdown (ie., knitr + markdown + pandoc)
    - Git + Github
    - stylesheets such as [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) (APA6 stylesheet)
  
- *Markdown*: Markdown is a simple variant of markup languages such as HTLM or LaTeX. Its marked feature is its simplicity. In fact, it can be learned in 5 minutes (whereas TeX may need 5-50 years, some say...).

- *Google Docs*: Easy, no (direct) costs, comfortable, but some features are lacking - There's no easy for citations. In addition, some say intellectual rights are transferred to Google by using G Docs (I have no clue whether that's true).


# Tool comparison table


```r

pacman::p_load(char = libs)
```



```r
tools <- read_csv("academic_writing_tools_competition.csv")
```






```r
pander(df)
```

# Criterion weight

Let's assume we have some weights that we assign to the critera:


-----------------------------------
Criterion                  Weight  
-------------------------- --------
Beautiful typesetting      1       

Different output formats   2

# Scores by tool

So we are able to devise a score or a ranking.


-------------------------
tool_name         score  
----------------- -------
Full              69     

Overleaf_Authorea 61     

Tex               58     

Markdown          54     

G_Docs            47     

Word              41     
-------------------------



```r
score %>% ggplot + aes(x = reorder(tool_name, score), y = score) + 
    geom_point() + coord_flip() + xlab("tool")
```

# And the winner is...

**The full approach**. The full approach gets most points (disclaimer: well, I designed this compeition, and I like this approach ðŸ˜„.
